# Overview
This repository contains code for investigating how often manuscripts in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology that cite the R software language make their R code available. The R scripts that this work relies upon are contained in the folder 'R_scripts'.  The data generated by this work (which includes both scripted and manual components) are stored in the 'data' folder.  The 'figures' folder contains figures produced for a related manuscript (in review). For more information, see the preprint at: https://www.authorea.com/doi/full/10.22541/au.170003886.68548206/v1

# Important Data

The main datafile in this repository is "data/cite_data.RDS". This is an RDS file containing information on citation counts for R files and associated predictor variables.  Many of the variables are returned from the Rscopus package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rscopus/index.html) using the scopus API (https://dev.elsevier.com/sc_apis.html). Metadata on fields returned by the scopus API is available at https://dev.elsevier.com/sc_apis.html.  Below, we provide information on fields which are NOT returned by the scopus API (i.e., data which we collected).

* uid = A unique ID assigned to each record.
* r_scripts_available = A binary variable (yes/no) describing whether any R code was shared as part of the publication.
* r_used = A binary variable (yes/no) describing whether R was used in the publication (as opposed to simply referenced without being used).
* data_available = A binary variable (yes/no) describing whether the full data underlying the publication were included.
* comments = Unstructured comments about the record.  This may contain information about why a judgement was made or where code was found.
* code location = Text string describing where the code was located, options include:  NA, "SI", "figshare", "website", "appendix", "dryad", "github", "Github", "zenodo", "environmental data initiative", "sciencebase.gov", "mendeley data", "osf", "bitbucket"   
* code format = Text string describing the format a code was shared in, options include: NA, "word", "pdf", "R", "typeset text", "rtf", "txt", "rmd"  
* code license = Text string describing the license for the shared code, if any. Note that "NA" means that a license was not specified, where NA means we did not check. Options include: NA, "NA", "GPL", "CC0", "CC-BY", "MIT", "Open", "copyright" 
* n A numeric index variable used to stratify randomization.
