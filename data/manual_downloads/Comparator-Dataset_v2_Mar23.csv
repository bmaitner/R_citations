Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  2. can you describe this person to me? Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  3. what is it that this person does that you find admirable? there were no direct questions about the role modelâ€™s gender, which was determined by the participantâ€™s use of gendered pronouns or of names identifiable as male or female.",N/A,N/A,N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,No,No,N/A

[ 30 ] and tian et al. [ 31 ], this paper selected hce as the dependent variable, and iwge, income, government financial expenditure and so on as the independent variables. it is worth noting that the density of commercial life insurance and chronic diseases were introduced to be independent variables since they had a positive impact on the hce. more specifically, the dependent variable was per capita individual hce, the independent variable was per capita iwge, and the control variables included were per capita income, chronic diseases, and per capita government financial expenditure, the density of commercial life insurance, the old dependency ratio and health technicians. for convenience, these variables are called hce, iwge, income, gfe, dcli, odr, cd and ht, respectively. the relevant definitions and explanations of variables are shown in  table 1 . the data on per capita individual hce, per capita income, per capita government financial expenditure, and the old dependency ratio were from the national bureau of statistics of china (nbsc). the data of per capita iwge were obtained from the china statistical yearbook on the environment (csye) and the density of commercial life insurance from the yearbook of chinaâ€™s insurance (yci). this study also obtained the data on chronic diseases and health technicians from the china health and family planning statistical yearbook (chfpsy). there are two things to note: first, it is reasonable to use iwge represented industrial air pollution since iwge is the primary indicator of industrial air pollution listed in csye. as part of iwge, the sulfur dioxide emission and other indicators will be studied deeply in the future. second, data on chronic diseases are directly derived from chfpsy, where the prevalence rates of chronic diseases are a hybrid concept. it is not a specific chronic disease but refers to those who have one chronic disease at least. in addition, the prevalence rates of chronic diseases were based on 2013 data due to the prevalence rate remaining relatively stable, which were 538.8â€° in 2003, and 539.9â€° in 2013 over the age of 65. the relevant price data were normalized to be in the 2004 constant price. meanwhile, in order to reduce the dimensional effects and normalizing requirements, all the data are transformed into their natural logarithmic values.",N/A,N/A,N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Method,Yes,No,N/A

[ 77 ] which is appropriate for very homogeneous populations, and six key respondents purposively selected (five cell agronomists, one sector agronomist) respectively were interviewed for primary data collection. only one household representative member was chosen to respond to a set of questions during the household survey. the choice of the six key informants was motivated by their critical roles in the implementation of luc and cip programs at the local level and their likelihood to bear the information about food security in the area as agronomists. the questionnaires were drawn in english language and translated in kinyarwanda. all the questions were asked in kinyarwanda as the local language and the answers translated in english by the authors later. this technique of combining households survey (quantitative non-experimental) and other qualitative methods in the assessment of programs and policy impacts is very famous in social sciences and has been widely used by many other researchers in the same context [ 8 , 20 , 24 , 26 , 33 , 34 , 35 ] which makes it a more credible and reliable approach. the triangulation and back-checking techniques were used to check the validity and reliability of the collected data, and were chosen for their extensive use in mixed studies like this one. the information about the failure of luc to meet food security in the study area was primarily obtained by collecting the perceptions of respondents about the status of household food security before and after the introduction of luc from the household representatives (heads) through a household survey and the key informantâ€™s interviews. all the householdsâ€™ respondents were asked to choose one answer among four different pre-established indicators of food security in their households after the introduction of luc. these four indicators include, first, optimal uptake of nourishment which indicates food security in all its aspects (food quantity, food quality, food availability, food accessibility, food utilization or usage, and food sustainability). second, sufficient balanced food availability which indicates the presence of food security in terms of the availability of diverse foodstuffs (food quality) in sufficient quantity. third, sufficient access to food which indicates the accessibility of food in terms of quality and quantity for food security. lastly, insufficient balanced food availability which indicates food insecurity in terms of the unavailability of diverse foodstuffs (food quality) and quantity. on the other hand, the key respondents as more educated people, were asked to compare the status of household food security in all its aspects such as food quantity, food quality, food sustainability/stability, food availability, food accessibility, and food usage/utilization before and after the introduction of luc in their area. each key respondent was also required to give a motivation for this comparison. the information about the level of farmerâ€™s satisfaction about luc and the reasons for their satisfaction level has also been gathered through a household survey, in order to check whether food insecurity indicators could be one of the main factors of satisfaction, and which indicators could be linked with the failure of luc. this helped to answer the questions about whether and how luc failed to meet food security. both descriptive statistics along with text description were used to analyze quantitative and qualitative primary data to draw statistical and thematic conclusions about the research questions. a correlation diagram drawn from the primary data, literature review and the authors knowledge about luc and food security nexus was used to show the causal-effects relationships among different factors and variables in different food insecurity scenarios before and after luc in the study area. this helped to show how luc failed to meet its food security objectives as a multidimensional concept, rather exacerbated the issue by contributing to other forms of food insecurity scenarios when combined with exogenous factors like climate change and market imperfections among others. in order to verify why and how luc influences food security targets, the study performed an analysis of the existing luc policy (objectives and guiding principles) and of its formulation and implementation process in the study area. the main target information was the level of farmerâ€™s participation in the process, which could give insights about the independency of land use rights as an indicator of tenure security and factor of food security, as pre-established in the conceptual framework in the literature section. luc process and main stakeholdersâ€™ diagram was drawn from the information gathered from the literature and governmental reports, along with the primary data from farmers during household survey and key informantâ€™s interviews. the level of farmerâ€™s participation was assessed by asking the household members during the household survey whether they participated in 3 main activities of luc implementation process (provision of parcels and farming activities, choice of the priority crop suitable to their area, and the post harvesting activities). once the gap found, it has been correlated/associated with tenure responsive land use planning principles in order to propose a better renewed approach to luc to make it more food security responsive as solution to the main study problem. a deductive review of the literature about tenure responsive land-use planning principles, luc guiding principles and food security aspects and components was performed to identify the gap in their relationships in the study area, answer the question about the reasons for their failure, and propose new solutions to mitigate food security challenges through tenure responsive land-use planning as secondary data sources to supplement the primary ones.",N/A,N/A,N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,No,No,N/A

(while season and weather are important considerations for outdoor data collection in most parts of the world, the cities of garden grove and anaheim experience temperate climates throughout the year.) in both parks, each target area was monitored by a trained researcher for a period of 3 days pre-intervention and 3 days post-intervention, with data collected across four 1-hour intervals (7:00â€“8:00 a.m., 12:00â€“1:00 p.m., 3:30â€“4:30 p.m., and 6:00â€“7:00 p.m.) each day. a total of 32 trained researchers participated in field data collection, monitored by the first author of this study. according to soparc guidelines, we divided each hour of monitoring into 15-min observation periods and recorded user activity continuously during each period [ 18 ]. one researcher was assigned to observe each target area for the duration of a 1-hour interval, which implies observations of four 15-min intervals. during those intervals, researchers recorded the gender, age group, and race/ethnicity of each user and categorized each userâ€™s physical activity level as sedentary, walking, or vigorous. equipment use (post-intervention) was coded as sedentary when the machines were not used as intended (e.g., used as seating rather than exercise) and as vigorous when each apparatus was used as intended. the smallest unit of measurement in the soparc data is 1 person-period, defined as a single park user who occupied a target area for all or part of a 15-min period. if a park user occupied the target area for longer than a single 15-min period, or if a park user left the target area and returned during a later period, the researcher recorded it as multiple unique person-periods [ 18 ]. field inter-rater reliability checks were conducted to assess agreement on levels of activity, race/ethnicity, and age [ 19 ]. park usersâ€™ recorded physical activity levels were subsequently converted into metabolic equivalent of task (met) scores, as recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention [ 21 ]. there were three possible met scores: sedentary was assigned 1.5 mets, walking was assigned 3.0 mets, and vigorous exercise was assigned 6.0 mets [ 22 ]. we calculated a period-average met score for each observation period in each target area by averaging the individual met scores for all person-periods in the time frame. the period-average met scores quantify the overall average level of user activity in each target area during each observation period. the following demographic characteristics were also recorded per person-period: gender (male or female); age group (child, teen, adult, senior); and race/ethnicity group (white, hispanic, black, other).",N/A,N/A,N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,DA,Yes,No,N/A

where at least one plant trait or agroecosystem property was measured on a pulse species (see complete reference list in supplementary tableÂ  s4 ). we selected 17 functional traits measured at the sub-individual or individual level, based on data completeness (tableÂ  1 ). we were able to document 43 pulse species on most of the traits selected (~5% of missing values) (tableÂ  1 ). the complete list of covered species is provided in supplementary materials (supplementary tableÂ  s1 ). species covered the two clads that gather the majority of legume crops, namely galegoid and phaseoloid, which are often referred to as cool season and tropical season legumes, respectively 5 .we also gathered data on six agroecosystem properties measured at the supra-individual (population) level, but these data were less complete than the traits (~17% missing values) (tableÂ  2 ). these six properties have identified relations with targeted ecosystem services. we considered that food provision under drought is a function of grain yield and water use efficiency (wue) (eq.Â  1 ). nitrogen supply service is predicted to be tightly related to biological nitrogen fixation (bnf) which is a function of the percentage of nitrogen derived from atmosphere (%ndfa) and biomass yield (by) (eq.Â  2 ). finally, competition against weeds was assessed by grain yield loss when the crop is subject to competition which we supposed to be function of maximum crop leaf area index (lai) divided by the time needed to reach the maximum lai (eq.Â  3 ). 1 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

13,4,2020,10.3390/s20082200,Motor Activity,Missing,Method,Yes,Yes,Supplementary Information|Online,"3.1. dataÂ collection data collection was made through an android app developed by the authors that allowed an easy recording, labeling and storage of the data. to do this, we organized an initial data collection that lasted about a month, to see what data we were getting and to be able to do some initial tests on it. later, we carried out another more intensive collection, over a period of about a week, to alleviate the imbalances and weaknesses found in the previous gathering. each of the people who took part in the study was asked to set the activity they were going to perform at each moment, through that android app, before starting the data collection. in this way, once the activity was selected, the gathering of such data was automatically started, until the user indicated the end of such activity. hence, each stored session corresponds to a specific activity, carried out by a particular individual. regarding the activities performed, they were four: inactive: not carrying the mobile phone. for example, the device is on the desk while the individual performs another kind of activities. active: carrying the mobile phone, moving, but not going to a particular place. in other words, this means that, for example, making dinner, being in a concert, buying groceries or doing the dishes count as â€œactiveâ€ activities. walking: moving to a specific place. in this case, running or jogging count as a â€œwalkingâ€ activity. driving: moving in a means of transport powered by an engine. this would include cars, buses, motorbikes, trucks and any similar. the data collected comes from four different sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer and gps. we selected accelerometer and gyroscope because they are the most used in the literature and the ones that showed the best results. we also added the magnetometer and gps because we think they could be useful in this problem. in fact, in our case, gps should be essential to differentiate the activities performed by being able to detect the userâ€™s movement speed who carries the smartphone. we save the data of the accelerometer, the gyroscope and the magnetometer with their tri-axial values. in the case of gps, we store the deviceâ€™s increments in latitude, longitude and altitude, as well as the bearing, speed and accuracy of the collected measurements. also, for the accelerometer, we used the gravity sensor, subtracting the last reading of the latter from the observations of the first. in this way, we get clear accelerometer values (linear accelerometer), as they are not affected by the smartphoneâ€™s orientation. therefore, we obtain a dataset independent of the place where the individual is, as well as of the deviceâ€™s bearings. on the other hand, before saving the data locally, a series of filters are applied. in the case of the accelerometer and magnetometer, we use a low-pass filter to avoid too much noise in these sensorâ€™s measurements. concerning the gyroscope, to bypass the well-known gyro drift, a high-pass filter was used instead. nevertheless, we also had to deal with androidâ€™s sensor frequency problem, as we cannot set the same frequency for each one of them. in our case, this is especially problematic, having to join data from very high-frequency sensors such as the accelerometer, with a low-frequency sensor, such as the gps. from the latter, we obtain new measurements every ten seconds, approximately, compared to the possible ten, or even 50, measurements per second we can get from the accelerometer. anyhow, given the inability to set a frequency in android and having to take the values as they are offered by the system itself, there may be gaps in the measurements. these gaps are especially problematic in the case of gps, where there may be cases where no new measurements were obtained in more than a minute (although perhaps this is mainly due to the difficulty of accessing closed environments). such gaps also occur in the case of the accelerometer, gyroscope or magnetometer, despite offering about 10, 5 or 8 measurements per second, respectively, in the most stable cases. in these cases, the gaps are between 1 and 5 s, and occur mostly at the start of each data collection session, although much less frequently than with gps. in this way, in  table 2 , we show the average number of recordings per second for each sensor and each activity measured, as well as the resulting average frequency. below each average value, in a smaller size, we also show the standard deviation for each class. please note that for moving activities such as â€œactiveâ€ or â€œwalkingâ€ there is an increase in these measurements, especially with the accelerometer. this is because the smartphone detects these movements and, to get the most information, its frequency is increased automatically to get the maximum number of measurements. however, this increase also occurs during â€œdrivingâ€ activity, even more so. vibrations due to the car use may be the cause of this increase, as they might also be detected by the sensors of the smartphone. additionally, in â€œwalkingâ€ and â€œactiveâ€ activities there may be certain inactive intervals (like waiting for a traffic light to go green or just standing doing something, respectively) that lower these averages. in this way, the final distribution of the activities in our dataset is the one shown in  table 3 . in this table, we measured the total time recorded, the number of recordings, the number of samples and the percentage of data (this one related to the number of samples), for each of the activities we specified. here, each recording refers to a whole activity session, since the individuals begin an action until they stop it; while each sample is related to a single sensor measurement. as can be seen, there are less samples on â€œinactiveâ€ activities in proportion to the total time recorded. this is because the frequency of the sensors increases with activities that require more movement, as explained above, so in these cases they remained at a lower value. therefore, the total percentage of the data may give a wrong view of the total data distribution, once the sliding windows are applied. this is because, by using these windows on which to compute a series of features, the number of samples actually moves into second place, with the total time recorded being the most important value. the more total time recorded, the more sliding windows computed, and the more patterns for that class. hence, there would be a much clearer imbalance in the dataset, where â€œinactiveâ€ activity would have three times as many patterns as in the case of â€œwalkingâ€. regarding the number of recordings made, there are far more with the â€œwalkingâ€ activity than with the rest. anyhow, we consider that the dataset remains useful and feasible to implement models that could distinguish these activities. moreover, the total number of individuals who participated in the study was 19. therefore, the dataset also contains different kinds of behaviors that end up enriching the possible models developed later. on the other hand, there is also another problem in android, as not all devices contain a gyroscope or a magnetometer to this day. while it is mandatory to have an accelerometer and a gps, a gyroscope or a magnetometer are not compulsory in older versions of android. in this way, some of our users took measurements without including these sensors. in  table 4  and  table 5 , we show the number of samples that do not include a gyroscope or a gyroscope and a magnetometer simultaneously, as the people who did not have a magnetometer did not have a gyroscope either. something important to highlight in these tables is the difference in the relation between the number of samples and the time recorded compared to the one showed in  table 3 . here, the number of samples is much higher in relation to the time recorded. this may explain the strange data that we pointed out before in  table 2 , as the accelerometer may increase more its frequency in general, by becoming the only sensor to detect motion. on another note, the percentages we show in this table are related to the whole amount of data, from  table 3 . fortunately, these percentages are quite low, and the dataset is not as affected by this problem. anyhow, it will be something to keep in mind when preparing the data to be applied to

23,1,2020,10.3390/ijerph17030731,"Coronary Artery Disease, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine",Missing,Method,Yes,No,N/A,"2. data mining classification methods in this section, we describe the classification methods used in this study. these methods include chaid decision tree, c5.0 decision tree, random trees, and support vector machine (svm). among the mentioned methods, except for the support vector machine, chaid, c5.0, because random trees (rts) are based on the decision tree, rules are extracted that are useful for the diagnosis of cad, especially rule extraction using rts. 2.1. decision tree of chaid the chi-squared automatic interaction detection (chaid) is one of the oldest tree classifications, and it is a supervised learning method by building the decision tree, which is evidence of the rules extraction, which is proposed by kass [ 16 ]. this classification model is a statistical method based on the diagnosis of chi-squared automatic interaction, and it is a recessive partitioning method that can be obtained by input features as predictors and the predictive class, a chi-squared statistic test between target class and the predictive features are computed [ 17 , 18 , 19 ] so that the predictive features are ranked in order of their priority. as such, the most significant predictors of subset feature with the highest probability of their weight to diagnose cad can be gained. it should be noted that the process of selecting a significant predictor feature is based on data sample segmentation so that until we reach an external node i.e., the leaf, the samples partition continues into smaller subdivisions [ 17 , 20 ]. in general, the chaid model includes the following steps [ 17 , 18 , 19 ]: reading predictors: the first step is to make classified predictors or features out of any consecutive predictors by partitioning the concerned consecutive disseminations into a number of classifiers with almost equal numbers of observations. for classified predictors, the classifiers or target classes are determined. consolidating classifiers: the second step is to round through the features to estimate for each feature the pair of feature classifiers that is least significantly different with regard to the dependent variable. in this process, the chiad model includes two types of statistical tests. one, for the classification dataset, it will gain a chi-square test or pearson chi-square. the assumptions for chi-square test are as follows: n ij  = the value of observations concerned with feature fields or sample size, g ij  = the gained expected feature fields for datasets, for example, the training dataset  ( x n Â  = Â  i , Â  y n Â  = Â  j ) , v n  = the value weight ( w n ) concerned with per sample of dataset, d f  = the most number of logically independent values, which are values that have the freedom to vary, in the dataset, namely, degrees of freedom.  d f  is equal to ( nij âˆ’ 1 ). c  = the corresponsive data sample, afterward: (1) x 2 = âˆ‘ j = 1 j âˆ‘ i = 1 d ( n i j âˆ’ g i j ) 2 g i j ,   (2) n i j = âˆ‘ n Îµ c f n d f ( x n = i Â  âˆ© Â  y n = j ) . two, for regression datasets where the dependent variable is consecutive, for measure-dependent variables,  f -tests are used. if the concerned test for a given pair of feature classifiers is not statistically significant as defined by an alpha-to-consolidate value, then it will consolidate the concerned feature classifiers and iterate this step, i.e., obtain the next pair of classifiers, which now may include previously consolidated classifiers. if the statistical significance for the concerned pair of feature classifiers is significant, i.e., less than the concerned alpha-to-consolidate value), then it will gain optionally a bonferroni adopted  p -value for the set of classifiers for the concerned feature.

(8) i n f o Â  g a i n ( s , k ) = âˆ‘ i = 1 n âˆˆ c i p i Â  Ã— i n f o Â  e n t r o p y ( s i ) ,   (9) i n f o Â  e n t r o p y ( s ) = Â  âˆ’ Â  âˆ‘ j = 1 n âˆˆ c i p i l o g 2 p i . based on equations (8) and (9), the number of  k  features, a partition  s  according to values of  k , and where  p  is the probability distribution of division ( c1 ,  c2 , â€¦,  ci ):  (10) p = ( | c 1 | / | s | , Â  | c 2 | / | s | , Â  â€¦ , Â  | ci | / | s | ) . based on equation (10),  ci  is the number of disjoint classes and  | s |  is the number of samples in set of  s . the value of gain is computed as follows.  (11) g a i n Â  ( s , k ) = Â  i n f o Â  e n t r o p y ( s ) âˆ’ i n f o Â  g a i n ( s , k ) . ratio instead of gain was suggested by quinlan so that  split info (k,c)  is the information due to the division of  c  on the basis of value of categorical feature  k , using the following: (12) s p l i t Â  i n f o ( k , c ) = Â  i n f o Â  e n t r o p y ( | c 1 | | c | , | c 2 | | c | , Â  â€¦ , | c i | | c | ) ,   (13) g a i n r a t i o ( k , c ) Â  = Â  g a i n ( k , c ) Â  / Â  s p l i t Â  i n f o ( k , c ) . for equations (12) and (13), where  ( c 1 , Â  c 2 , Â  â€¦ Â  ci )  is the partition of  c  induced by value of  k . 2.3. support vector machine support vector machine (svm) is a supervised learning model based on statistical learning theory and structural risk minimization [ 29 , 30 ] presented by vapnic that only the data assigned in the support vectors are based on machine learning and model building. the svm model is not sensitive to other data points and its aim is to find the best separation line, i.e., the optimal hyperplane between the two classes of samples so that it has the maximum distance possible to all the two classes of support vectors [ 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 ]. the predictor feature is determined by the separator line for each predictive class.  figure 2  shows the scheme of the support vector machine in two-dimensional space. regarding  figure 2 , a description of svm model is as follows:  allow training data sample  { ( x i , Â  y i ) } i = 1 â€¦ n , Â  x i âˆˆ r d  and the data of the two classes labeled  y i Â  âˆˆ Â  { âˆ’ 1 , Â  1 }  to be separated by a optimal hyperplane in a  { x â”‚ âŒ© w , x âŒª + b = 0 }  so it is assigned in the middle of the other two lines, i.e.,  { x â”‚ âŒ© w , x âŒª Â  + Â  b Â  = Â  + 1 } Â  a n d Â  { x â”‚ âŒ© w , x âŒª Â  + Â  b = âˆ’ 1 }  with margin  m  that the margin  ( m = 2 âˆ¥ w âˆ¥ )  of the separator is the distance between support vectors, data samples closest to the hyperplane are support vectors, and also,  b  represents the offset between the optimal hyperplane and the origin plane. then for each training sample  ( x i , Â  y i ) :  (14) { w t x i Â  + Â  b Â  â‰¤ Â  âˆ’ m 2 Â  i f Â  y i Â  = Â  âˆ’ 1 w t x i Â  + Â  b Â  â‰¥ Â  m 2 Â  i f Â  y i Â  = Â  1 } â†” y i ( w t x i + b ) â‰¥ m 2 . according to the hyperplane optimization that the svm model was meant to solve, the optimization problem is as follows [ 29 ]: (15) m i n i m i z e : Â  1 2 Â  âˆ¥ w âˆ¥ 2 Â  s u b j e c t e d Â  t o : Â  y i ( w . x + b ) âˆ’ 1 â‰¥ 0 Â  âˆ€ i . to solve the problem of equation (15), one has to obtain the dual of the problem using the lagrange method, namely, ( lp ). to obtain the dual form of the problem, the nonnegative lagrangian coefficients are multiplied by Î±i â‰¥ 0. l p  is defined as follows: (16) l p = 1 2 Â  | w | 2 âˆ’ âˆ‘ i Â  Î± i Â  ( y i ( w . x + b ) âˆ’ 1 . finally, equation (16) is transformed into the following equation [ 29 ]: (17) maximize Â  : l d = âˆ‘ i Î± i âˆ’ 1 2 âˆ‘ i âˆ‘ j Î± i Î± j y i y j ( x i x j ) . equation (17) is called the dual problem, namely,  l d . however, for nonlinear svm due to the absence of trade-off between maximizing the margin and the misclassification. therefore, it could not obtain the linear separate hyperplane in the data sample. in the nonlinear space, the best solution, the basic data of higher dimension, i.e., feature space, of the linear separate is transformed. at the end, kernel functions are used, such as linear, polynomial, radial basis function (rbf), and sigmoid [ 29 ]. based on equation (18), l d  for the nonlinear data sample is obtained. in equation (18), parameter  c  is the penalty agent and determines the measure of penalty placed to a fault, so that the â€œ c â€ value is randomly selected by the user.  (18) maximize Â  Ï† ( w , b , Î¾ , Î± , Î² ) : l d = âˆ‘ i = 1 n Î± i âˆ’ 1 2 âˆ‘ i = 1 n âˆ‘ j = 1 n Î± i Î± j y i y j k ( x i , x j ) subjected Â  to Â  âˆ‘ j Î± j y j = 0 , Â  0 â‰¤ Î± i â‰¤ c , Â  i = 1 , â€¦ , n . n  is the number of data samples in equation (18). in this study, the radial basis function (rbf) [ 29 ] is selected as the kernel function as shown in equation (19):  (19) k ( x i , x j ) = Â  exp ( âˆ’ Ï’ âˆ¥ x i âˆ’ x j âˆ¥ 2 . in equation (19), the kernel parameter of  Ï’  with respect to ( Ï’ â‰¥ 0 )  represents the width of the rbf. 2.4. random trees the model of random trees (rts) is one of the robust predictive models, better than other classification models in terms of accuracy computing, data management, more information gain with eliminating fewer features, extracting better rules, working with more data, and more complex networks. therefore, the model for disease diagnosis is suitable. this model consists of multiple trees randomly with high depth so that the most significant votes are chosen from a set of possible trees having  k  random features at each node. in other words, in the set of trees, each tree has an equal probability of being assigned. due to the experiments performed in the classification of the dataset, the accuracy of the rts model is more accurate than the other models because it uses the evaluation of several features and composes functions. therefore, rts can be constructed efficiently and the combination of large datasets of random trees generally leads to proper models. there has been vast research in recent years of rts in the field of machine learning [ 33 ]. generally, random trees is confirmed as a crucial performance as compared to the classifiers presented as a single tree in this study. if we consider random trees at very high dimensions with a complex network, then it can include the following steps [ 33 , 34 ]:  using the  n  data sample randomly, in the training dataset to develop the tree. each node as a predictive feature grasps a random data sample selected so that  m  <  m  ( m  represents the selected feature and  m  represents the full of features in the corresponding dataset. given that during the growth of trees,  m  is kept constant.) using the  m  features selected for generating the partition in the previous step, the  p  node is computed using the best partition path from points.  p  represents the next node. for aggregating, the prediction dataset uses the tree classification voting from the trained trees with  n  trees. for generating the terminal rts, the model uses the biggest voted features. the rts process continues until the tree is complete and reaches only one leaf node.",N/A,N/A,N/A,TRUE,10.20944/preprints202001.0220.v1,21,1,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.20944/preprints202001.0220.v1,Preprints.org,DA,Yes,No,N/A

materials and modeling methods  we incorporated a coupled regional air quality modeling system based on the weather research and forecasting (wrf) model version 3.7 [ 27 ] and the community multiscale air quality (cmaq) model version 5.2 [ 28 ] into the bluesky fire smoke modeling framework [ 12 ]. the wrf model ( https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model ) is a mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting applications. the cmaq model ( https://www.epa.gov/cmaq ) is a numerical air quality model developed to simulate atmospheric chemistry and dynamic transport of air pollutants. we used a one-way coupled wrf-cmaq modeling system with the cmaq simulation driven by wrf meteorological outputs without consideration of chemistry feedbacks to the weather. although previous studies [ 29 , 30 ] suggested significant effects of two-way interactions between chemistry and meteorology through radiative and cloud processes, such feedback effects are beyond the scope of this work, given the expensive computational burden and large uncertainties in these feedback processes. here, the data integration methods will be introduced specifically to reduce modeling bias related to such limitations of the modeling framework and simulation settings. fire emissions for numerical simulations were estimated based on the bluesky framework [ 12 ], which incorporates satellite-based fire detection information (e.g., fire size and location) with fuel loadings and moisture conditions to calculate fuel consumption and fire emissions. all fire and non-fire emissions were processed by the sparse matrix operator kernel emissions (smoke) model [ 31 ] in the cmaq system [ 28 ] to generate model-ready gridded emission inputs after spatial (i.e., horizontal and vertical) and temporal allocation as well as chemical speciation. to isolate fire source contributions to the regional air pollution episode and consequent public health effects, we designed two wrf-cmaq simulation experiments: a control experiment (ctrl) with only non-fire emission sources (i.e., anthropogenic and natural sources) and a sensitivity experiment (sens) with both fire and non-fire sources ( table 1 ). the sens experiment with all sources was compared with space- and ground-based observations for model evaluation.  uncertainties in model inputs and physical assumptions may result in large bias in model outputs such as pm 2.5  concentrations. therefore, we applied several ml-based data fusion algorithms to reduce these modeling biases, rather than directly using modeling results for assessing regional health consequences of fire smoke exposure. specifically, we designed a two-step approach based on three ml algorithms: ordinary multi-linear regression (mlr), a generalized boosting model (gbm), and a random forest (rf) method. the last two algorithms were suggested by a previous study [ 33 ], in which the researchers compared a set of 11 ml algorithms and demonstrated the favorable performance of the gbm and rf methods for predicting pm 2.5  concentrations during a 2008 fire event in california. specifically, a two-step data integration approach was followed in this work: (1) step 1: gap filling for spatiotemporal missing values in the multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (maiac) satellite aod retrievals [ 34 ]. this was based on (1) three hourly meteorological variables including total cloud fraction, cloud liquid water content, and surface water vapor mixing ratio from the wrf outputs, (2) two geographical variables including terrain elevation and vegetation coverage, and (3) the simulated hourly aod from the wrf-cmaq sens experiment; (2) step 2: data fusion for optimizing daily surface pm 2.5  concentrations from the wrf-cmaq sens experiment, based on (1) daily averages of observational airnow surface pm 2.5  measurements, (2) gap-filled aod from step 1, and (3) six meteorological variables, including surface wind speed and directions at 10 m, surface air temperature at 2 m, relative humidity at 2 m, precipitation rates at surface on a log scale, and planetary boundary layer heights from the north american regional reanalysis (narr) data [ 35 ] produced by the national centers for environmental prediction. we used the mlr algorithm as the benchmark for the other two advanced ml algorithms (gbm and rf) and compared the performance of the three statistical algorithms in step 1 and 2. an mlr model can be described by the following equation:  (1) y = Î± + âˆ‘ k Î² k x k + Îµ ,  where  x  and  y  are explanatory and dependent variables,  Î±  and  Î²  are intercept and slope coefficients,  Îµ  is the error term, and  k  is the number of explanatory variables ( k > 1 ) such as the observational and simulated aod and meteorological variables. in comparison, the gbm and rf methods are tree-based algorithms using decision trees as base learners. they use multiple features to split the whole training dataset into small subsets like branching of a tree, and then fit models on subset samples for each tree branch. this process is repeated by resampling the original training data with the bootstrap technique so that a large number of trees could grow. they share similar features by combining ensemble model outputs from each individual tree, but they differ on how the trees are built. for instance, gbm is based on shallow trees, with emphasis on poorly predicted instances by previously built models when growing trees sequentially, while rf is based on fully grown trees in parallel by treating all instances equally. rf also uses a random subset of features for each candidate split in the learning process to decorrelate the grown trees. these fundamental differences may affect the modeling performance of gbm and rf in specific cases, but both require parameter selection and model tuning efforts to achieve optimal performance. we used the r packages including â€œlmâ€ [ 36 ], â€œgbmâ€ [ 37 ], and â€œrandomforestâ€ [ 38 ] for statistical modeling and data integration. after data fusion processing, we evaluated modeling performance during the study period (8/15â€“9/14/2017) from different perspectives including spatial distributions, temporal variations, and aerosol chemical composition.  table 2  lists all the observational datasets used for the model evaluation.  for aerosol horizontal distributions, we collected the mcd19a2 version 6 of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (modis) terra and aqua combined maiac aod at 550 nm product [ 34 ] from the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa). this relatively new satellite product was successfully used to estimate surface pm 2.5  concentrations with full-coverage in other regions [ 40 ]. for aerosol vertical distributions, we used the l1b v3.00 aerosol cross section product [ 39 ] from the cloud-aerosol transport system (cats) aboard the international space station (iss). due to the unique orbit path of the iss, cats could observe the same spot on earth at different times each day, providing more comprehensive coverage of the tropics and mid-latitudes than sun-synchronous orbiting satellites [ 39 ]. for bulk pm 2.5  temporal variations, we collected airnow in situ pm 2.5  surface concentrations. we also collected in situ aerosol speciation measurements from the interagency monitoring of protected visual environments (improve) program for pm 2.5  chemical composition. to screen the optimal ml algorithm with the best modeling performance, we applied 10-fold cross-validation (cv) during the model training and parameter tuning processes of the two ml algorithms. the 10-fold cv was conducted by partitioning the whole data samples into 10 equal sized subsets, and then using nine subsets for model training and the remaining subset for testing purpose. the cross-validation process was repeated 10 times (the folds) until each of the subsets was used for validation once. the final model evaluation results were obtained by averaging all the results from the 10 validation processes. we evaluated their performance in terms of multiple statistical metrics such as mean absolute error (mae), fractional bias (fb), r-squared (r 2 ), and root mean squared error (rmse) (see  supplementary materials ). lastly, we assessed regional health impacts of fire smoke aerosols based on optimized surface pm 2.5  estimates and a relative risk function for multiple-cause mortality following the method of a fire smoke-focused health assessment study [ 1 ].  table 3  lists the input data used for the regional health impact assessment. demographic data were collected from the 2010 usa census grids provided by the nasa socioeconomic data and applications center (sedac). multiple-cause mortality data at the county level over the pnw during and after the fire smoke pollution episode were collected from the 2017 multiple cause of death online database by wide-ranging online data for epidemiologic research (wonder) of centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). the multiple-cause mortality attributable to pm 2.5  exposure during the fire smoke pollution episode was estimated using the following exposure-response function adapted from johnston et al. [ 1 ]: (2) m o r t a l i t y Â  a t t r i b u t a b l e Â  t o Â  p m 2.5 Â  e x p o s u r e = âˆ‘ p m 2.5 n d p m 2.5 Ã— m Ã— ( r r s i ( p m 2.5 ) âˆ’ 1 ) ,  where  p m 2.5  is daily average surface pm 2.5  concentrations with minimum and maximum values of 5 and 200 Î¼g m âˆ’3 , respectively. following johnston et al. [ 1 ], we excluded the grid cells with daily exposure estimates of less than 5 Î¼g m âˆ’3  and fixed grid cells with exposure estimates larger than 200 Î¼g m âˆ’3  to a maximum threshold of 200 Î¼g m âˆ’3 . although there is little evidence for a threshold pm 2.5  mortality function, the minimum threshold was set to reflect the less certainty of the shape of the exposure-response relationship at low pm 2.5  levels [ 41 ], while the maximum threshold was set to represent the flat shape of the exposure-response relationship at high concentration levels [ 42 ].  d p m 2.5  is the number of days with daily pm 2.5  at certain levels between each pm 2.5  concentration interval (i.e., each 1 Î¼g m âˆ’3  increment between 5 Î¼g m âˆ’3  and 200 Î¼g m âˆ’3 ),  n  is the total number of concentration intervals,  m  is the county-level daily average number of multiple cause of deaths between august-december of 2017, and  r r s i  is a relative risk function for multiple-cause mortality due to short-term pm 2.5  exposure. we downscaled the county-level multiple cause of deaths ( m ) to the model-grid scale according to the high-resolution gridded population density data from the 2010 usa census grids. therefore, we were able to estimate population exposure risks with both gridded mortality and pm 2.5  concentrations at the same resolution of modeling grids (i.e., 4 km).",N/A,"https://tools.airfire.org, http://www.nasa.gov/NPP, https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model, https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/12/2137/s1, http://lar.wsu.edu/airpact/, https://www.epa.gov/cmaq",N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,DA|Method|Supplementary|Fulltext,Yes,Yes,Online

[ 18 ] mentioned that senior management, employee acceptance, interdepartmental coordination, organizational systems, organizational infrastructure, usable resources, degree of industrial adoption, pressure of market competition and reasonable charge of the cloud service influenced cloud computing adoption in small and medium enterprises. in addition, amiri [ 35 ] also pointed out that the degree of education training and data access security were factors adopting saas. furthermore, arpaci [ 36 ] mentioned that data access security, information transmission security, usefulness of system operations and innovation and design were factors of cloud computing adoption in education that achieve knowledge management. raut et al. [ 37 ] mentioned that data access security, information system integration, information reliability and system expandability were the critical success factors of cloud computing adoption in the micro, small and medium enterprises (msmes). priyadarshinee et al. [ 38 ] verified that system security, including data access security, information transmission security and fallback cloud management security, were the determinants of cloud computing adoption. ke et al. [ 39 ] also indicated that information systems and communication stability could influence the cloud computing platform performance. in addition, vÃ¡zquez-poletti et al. [ 40 ] demonstrated that information system integration and infrastructure influenced the saas operation in a cloud computing environment. in addition, arpaci [ 41 ] pointed out that ease of use of the system operation influenced studentsâ€™ intention to use mobile cloud storage services. chang [ 42 ] proposed a framework for cloud computing adoption, covering senior management, ability of cloud service providers and relationship with cloud service providers. safari et al. [ 43 ] pointed out that interdepartmental coordination and pressure of market competition were the determinants of the adoption of saas. kim et al. [ 44 ] verified that degree of industrial adoption and promotion of government policy were the determinants of software-as-a-service adoption in small businesses. moreno-vozmediano et al. [ 45 ] pointed out that development of cloud service industry was a key challenge in cloud computing adoption. asadi et al. [ 46 ] verified that reasonable charge of cloud service and relationship with cloud service providers also influenced adoption of cloud computing in the banking sector. the aforementioned studies focused on factors or determinants of adopting the cloud model service. finally, summarizing the factors affecting the adoption of cloud service models mentioned in the above studies, a three-layer hierarchical table containing 27 factors is shown in  table 2 .  the pairwise questionnaires in this study were designed according to the suggestions of saaty and vargas [ 47 ] after the hierarchical factor table was established. the factors in each layer were measured using a ratio scale and a pairwise comparison method. their relative importance was compared, and then their importance was ranked in an ascending order and expressed by 1, 2, 3â€¦ 9. for instance,  table 3  is a questionnaire of the criteria layer comparing the technology facet, organization facet and environment facet. the factors were measured using a ratio scale. their relative importance was compared in ascending order from 1 to 9. based on the criteria layer, the respondents selected the relative importance of 2 factors out of 3 (technology, organization, and environment), as presented in  table 3 . as shown in  table 3 , the respondents appeared to think that technology is four times more important than organization and two times more important than environment, and that environment is two times more important than organization. the questionnaire design of the other layers is the same as that of the criteria layer. once the questionnaire was finalized, it was distributed to the top information technology managers at 20 large private hospitals in southern taiwan. because the topic of this research was the implementation of a cloud model by an expertsâ€™ survey, it was crucial to consider whether the experts were representative. in other words, the experts answering the questionnaires were required to have a long-term career and in-depth understanding in the field [ 48 ]. that is, questionnaires answered by experts from this field are more representative of field personnel when implementing a cloud service model and yield results that are closer to the actual situation of the field. therefore, the experts selected in the present study were senior information technology managers from the southern taiwanese private hospitals who had been working for at least 5 years. after the questionnaires were collected and reviewed, all appeared to have passed the consistency check. because fahp is a hierarchical analysis method and not a regression analysis method, the study did not require a large sample size [ 49 ]. with regard to the sample size for expert questionnaires, delbecq et al. [ 50 ] claimed that 15 to 30 participants was a reasonable sample size, while robbins [ 51 ] stated that 5 to 7 participants were sufficient if the group of experts was highly homogeneous. the 20 participants to answer the expert questionnaire in the current study were representative for this research topic. although only 20 valid expert questionnaires were obtained, the number of samples required and the expertsâ€™ background and experience were in line with the research method. the samples could be used for research analysis. finally, analysis of the questionnaire data was conducted following fahp. assume  table 3  is the response of the first expert, the weight calculation was performed as follows.  4.1. starting matrix establishment because  a 12  = 4,  a 13  = 2,  a 23  = 1/2, based on the response of the first expert in  table 3 , the following is the starting matrix formula: a = [ a i j ] = [ 1 a 12 1 / a 12 1 Î» a 1 n Î» a 2 n Î¼ Î¼ 1 / a 1 n 1 / a 2 n o Î¼ Î» 1 ] = [ 1 4 2 1 4 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 ] 4.2. consistency check ci  and  cr  values were calculated as follows: [ 1 4 2 1 4 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 ] Ã— [ w 1 w 2 w 3 ] = [ w â€² 1 w â€² 2 w â€² 3 ] ,   Î» m a x = Â  1 n ( w â€² 1 w 1 + w â€² 2 w 2 + Î» + w â€² n w n )   w i = [ âˆ j = 1 n a i j ] 1 n / âˆ‘ i = 0 n [ âˆ j = 1 n a i j ] 1 n i ,  j  = 1, 2, 3â€¦,  n . (there were three factors, so  n  = 3.) from this formula, we calculated  w i  as follows:  w 1  = 4/7 = 0.571429,  w 2  = 1/7 = 0.142857,  w 3  = 2/7 = 0.285714.  w â€² 1  was then calculated as follows:  w â€² 1  = (1 Ã— 571429) + (4 Ã— 0.142857) + (2 Ã— 0.285714) = 1.714285,  w â€² 2  = 0.428571 and  w â€² 3  = 0.857143, so  Î» m a x  = 1/3 (1.714285/0.571429 + 0.428571/0.142857 + 0.857143/0.285714) = 3.000001.  c i Â  = Â  ( Î» m a x âˆ’ n ) / ( n âˆ’ 1 ) Â  = Â  ( 3.000001 Â  âˆ’ Â  3 ) / ( 3 Â  âˆ’ Â  1 ) Â  = Â  0.002002 , c r = ( c i / r i n ) Â  = Â  0.002002 / 0.525 Â  = Â  0.003813 . both  ci  and  cr  values were less than 0.1. the values met the consistency requirement and were acceptable. 4.3. fuzzy numbers and fuzzy positive reciprocal matrices were constructed according to  table 3 , the trapezoidal fuzzy number can be displayed as: [3,4,4,5], [1,2,2,3], and [1/3,1/2,1/2,1]. a fuzzy positive reciprocal matrix is established as follows: a = [ Â  a 11 Â  a 12

[ 34 ] was used. this index considers the following nine components: vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, cereals, fish, meat, dairy products, the ratio of monounsaturated lipids to saturated lipids and ethanol consumption. the median for each food group was estimated using the control group. for consumption of each typical mediterranean food higher than the median of the consumption distribution in the control group, a person received 1 point; consumption lower received zero points. for consumption of non-mediterranean foods lower than the median 1 point was awarded; consumption higher than the median received zero points. for ethanol consumption, only the intake of wine was taken into account, if it was between 5 and 25 g/day, women received 1 point and 0 if the value was higher or lower than that figure. the total score ranged from 0 (minimum adherence to a traditional md pattern) to 9 (maximum adherence). subsequently, this md adherence variable was categorized as: low adherence (0â€“2), middle (3â€“4), high (5â€“6) and very high (â‰¥7 points). 2.3.2. other variables current smokers were defined as those who smoked at least one cigarette per day in the last six months. the educational level of women was registered as: primary studies (eight years or less of basic education); secondary (four years of secondary education) and university (university or postgraduate studies). body mass index (bmi) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared. both, weight and height just before pregnancy, were obtained from the womanâ€™s medical records where it had been recorded by their doctor or nurse. the cutoff points of the world health organization were used to determine overweight and obesity in the participants. women with a bmi â‰¥ 30 kg/m 2  were classified as obese and those with a bmi â‰¥ 25 kg/m 2  but <30 kg/m 2  as overweight [ 35 ].",N/A,N/A,N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,DA,Yes,No,N/A

Â¶ six studies informing the rr estimate for established hsv-2 infection were in the americas, four were in south-east asia, and one was in western pacific. â€– range of individual-study estimates was 0Â·5 (95% ci 0Â·2â€“1Â·1) to 4Â·3 (1Â·5â€“12Â·4). estimates of the proportion of individuals with established hsv-2 infection (with 95% uncertainty intervals [uis]) or recently acquired hsv-2 infection (without 95% uis) for the general population, stratified by age (in 5-year age bands from age 15 years to 49 years), sex, and who region, were available from the 2012 who estimates for prevalent and incident hsv-2 infection, which were informed by a comprehensive literature review up to february, 2014, that included 111 studies. 1  for those estimates, incidence was derived by calibrating the force of infection (incidence per susceptible individual) to prevalence, assuming a constant force of infection by age. 22  prevalence was calculated for each year of age, and the force of infection was applied to the number of susceptible individuals at that age to estimate the number of new infections over 1 accumulated year of age. in addition, we combined age-stratified data from 44 studies of hsv-2 prevalence among msm and fsws (excluding those with hiv) with year of data collection 2000 or later and a sample size of 20 or greater. these data were collated during the same literature review but not used in the 2012 who estimates ( appendix 1 ). 1  after adjusting for assay performance, we weighted the data by sample size using a random-effects model to derive pooled estimates of the proportion of msm or fsws with established hsv-2 infection by who region. as hsv-2 prevalence data among msm were not available for the african and eastern mediterranean regions, we estimated the proportion of msm with established hsv-2 infection in these regions by multiplying the proportion of men in the general populations in those regions with established hsv-2 infection by the global (ie, all other who regions) mean ratio of established hsv-2 infection in msm to established hsv-2 infection in the general male population. for example, for african msm: p h s v - 2 _ e s t a b l i s h e d _ r = 5 , m s m = [ ( âˆ‘ r = 1 r = 4 p h s v - 2 _ e s t a b l i s h e d _ r , m s m p h s v - 2 _ e s t a b l i s h e d _ r , k = 1 ) / 4 ] Ã— p h s v - 2 _ e s t a b l i s h e d _ r = 5 , k = 1  where  r  denotes region ( r =1 for the americas,  r =2 for european,  r =3 for south-east asian,  r =4 for western pacific,  r =5 for african, and  r =6 for eastern mediterranean) and  k  denotes sex ( k =0 for women and  k =1 for men). we calculated the global mean ratio of established hsv-2 infection in msm to established hsv-2 infection in the general male population, [ ( âˆ‘ r = 1 r = 4 p h s v - 2 _ e s t a b l i s h e d _ r , m s m p h s v - 2 _ e s t a b l i s h e d _ r , k = 1 ) / 4 ]  to be 2Â·8. we used unaids estimates of the annual number of incident hiv infections by who region, age ( a ; 15â€“24 years, 25â€“49 years, and 15â€“49 years), and sex for 2016 ( n hiv_r,a,k ). not all estimates had 95% uis so we derived them when necessary on the basis of the size of available uncertainty bounds for other estimates (as a proportion of the estimate). in addition, we used unaids estimates of the distribution (relative proportion,  x ) of all incident hiv infections by key population (msm, fsws, people who inject drugs [pwid], transgender individuals, sexual partners of high-risk individuals, and other [all remaining individuals]) that were calculated by who region for 2015. 23  we used  x  to estimate the number of incident hiv infections occurring in fsws ( n hiv_r,fsw ), msm ( n hiv_r,msm ), and pwid ( n hiv_r,pwid ) in each region, assuming for pwid equal proportions in women and men and that all hiv transmissions were through contaminated equipment: n h i v _ r , f s w = âˆ‘ a , k n h i v _ r , a , k Ã— x r , f s w n h i v _ r , m s m = âˆ‘ a , k n h i v _ r , a , k Ã— x r , m s m n h i v _ r , a , k , p w i d = n h i v _ r , a , k Ã— x r , p w i d the number of incident infections among pwid was then used to estimate the number of incident hiv infections due to sexual transmission alone:  n hiv_r,a,k_sexual  =  n hiv_r,a,k â€ˆâ€“â€ˆ n hiv_r,a,k_pwid . the paf of incident hiv attributable to hsv-2 infection was calculated both for incident hiv infection from sexual transmission only (since hsv-2-associated hiv infection is sexually acquired) and for all incident hiv infections (with hiv infections in pwid being unaffected by hsv-2). the paf for all incident hiv infections was calculated by multiplying the paf for incident hiv infections from sexual transmission only by  n hiv_r,a,k_sexual / n hiv_r,a,k .",N/A,N/A,N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,DA,Yes,No,N/A

the other is the indc pledged scenario.  the global targets of the 2 Â°c and 1.5 Â°c scenarios are based on the assumption that global mean warming to this century end would be limited to well below 2 Â°c or 1.5 Â°c. these are idealized global scenarios and they are presented in the ipcc (intergovernmental panel on climate change) assessment report 5 and the 1.5 Â°c assessment report [ 18 , 19 ], respectively. the 1.5 Â°c or 2.0 Â°c warming condition is defined by projections in which the 9-year smoothed temperature reaches 1.5 Â°c or 2.0 Â°c warming relative to the preindustrial level in each climate model. a total of 46 simulations is used for 1.5 Â°c warming and 42 simulations for 2 Â°c warming. the multi-model ensemble mean is calculated for 1.5 Â°c and 2 Â°c. the indcs pledges were submitted by 192 countries. the national indc pledge has been continuously updated. this study analyzed 165 national indc pledges submitted as of may 2019, in which the european union (eu) member states submitted an indc pledge for the entire region. the indc pledge of each country may be found on the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) website [ 20 , 21 ]. the emission targets of countries range from absolute values to relative values of the baseline year level or the emission reduction targets relative to the baseline year level. we analyzed and extracted each countryâ€™s emission targets. the annual global emissions pathways were obtained using a linear interpolation between the last historical year and committed years (the 2030 year). for the post-2030 period, annual emission pathways were obtained by extending the continued action of emission reduction under indc scenarios ( figure 1 a). for additional information on the indc dataset, please refer to  supplementary material table s1  and the study of wang [ 22 , 23 ] ( table s1 ). in our discussion of the heat stress response in the global indc scenario, we used the indc â€˜continuous-actionâ€™ scenario and the indc â€˜delayed-actionâ€™ scenario. the first group (i) in  figure 1  is referred as the â€œdelayed actionâ€ scenarios, and the scenarios are emission projections that assume that the indc mitigation action delayed or stalled after 2030 and return to a no-policy trajectory. the third and fourth groups (iii, iv) are referred as the extended â€œcontinuous actionâ€ (indc commitment) scenario, and the scenarios are based on the assumption that the national indc actions of emission reduction will continue to the late 21st century and global emissions will decline steadily. the relatively constant decarbonization rates were followed for the period after 2030. 2.2. estimation of heat stress response to emissions 2.2.1. heat stress index calculation heat stress is calculated based on the wet-bulb temperature ( t w ). the daily maximum  t w ,  t w m a x , is calculated according to the algorithm described by tsonis [ 24 ] and davies-jones [ 25 ]. the calculation of  t w m a x  is based on the following formula: (1) e = e s ( t w ) âˆ’ c p d p Îµ l v ( t âˆ’ t w ) = e s ( t w ) âˆ’ a p ( t âˆ’ t w )  where  t  is dry bulb temperature;  t w  is wet-bulb temperature;  c pd  is isobaric heat capacity of dry air;  a  and  Îµ  are constants;  p  is pressure;  l v  is latent heat of vaporization of water; and  e s  is saturation water pressure. the integral expression of  e s ( t ) is as follows: (2) e s ( t ) = e s o exp [ l v r v ( 1 t 0 âˆ’ 1 t ) ]  where  e so  is saturated vapor pressure at  t 0  (273.15 k). all these data are from the simulation results obtained for 14 cmip5 gcms ( supplementary table s1 ). 2.2.2. estimated heat-stress change under the paris agreement heat-stress change under the paris agreement is estimated based on the following: firstly, to assess the global mean warming level induced by each greenhouse gas emission scenario. based on the 78 climate sensitivity experiments from the earth system models (esms) ensemble of cmip5 [ 26 ], we assessed the possible corresponding global mean temperature rise for various emission scenarios [ 22 , 23 ]; we also integrated several other studies (temperature rise levels for some pathways have been provided) [ 27 , 28 , 29 ]. after a comprehensive assessment, we determined the most likely range of temperature increase for the continuous and delayed mitigation pathways of indcs ( figure 1 b). secondly, to estimate the space pattern of heat-stress change. we used 14 esms from the cmip5 archives. these models have different levels of climate sensitivity [ 30 ] and represent a wide range of climate responses to emission scenarios.  supplementary table s2  summarizes information regarding the 14 esms used in this study. all model data were interpolated to a common 1.5Â° Ã— 1.5Â° horizontal grid. the spatial pattern of the heat stress in response to each scenario was identified using a time-slice approach, where the spatial state at a specific warming point related to  âˆ† t i n d c  (and the global targets of the 1.5 Â°c and 2 Â°c scenarios) was separately obtained from the decadal time slices with the respective mean warming for each model. the spatial simulations of future heat-stress change were based on the cmip5 models ensemble and the 5â€“95th percentile confidence intervals (cis) were estimated from 10,000 bootstrapped subsamples of data. the period of 1980â€“2010 was referred to as the present-day baseline and the preindustrial period was defined as 1861â€“1900. lastly, to evaluate population exposure to extreme heat stress. we used the population data from socioeconomic development scenarios of ssps [ 31 ] and the data were changed to a 1.5 Â°  Ã—  1.5Â° latitude/longitude grid to match the gcm resolution. the population exposed to an extreme wet-bulb temperature was calculated at a daily time resolution. if the wet-bulb temperature at a given grid cell exceeded the threshold value on a given day (for example, a wet-bulb temperature of 32 Â°c or 30 Â°c), then the grid cell was considered to be exposed, and the total number of exposed cells was counted in units of person-days. the total amount of annual exposure (in units of person-days) is the number of people multiplied by time. the uncertainty of the population exposure value is calculated by taking the 5â€“95th percentile confidence intervals of 14 gcms (to reduce the influence of predicted temperature outliers in several gcms).",N/A,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/12/2202/s1,mdpi.com,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,DA,Yes,Yes,Online

description to reflect interprovincial eco-efficiency in china, this study constructed a composite economicâ€“environmentalâ€“social framework ( figure 1 ) that reflects human welfare and sustainability, based on the relevant literature [ 37 , 38 ] as well as oecd ideas about eco-efficiency [ 39 ]. the framework also considers the united nationsâ€™ â€œchanging our world: the 2030 agenda for sustainable developmentâ€ and draws upon robert costanzaâ€™s â€œfull worldâ€ model for ecological economy [ 40 ]. in the proposed composite system, nature provides the environmental capacity for human development. the economic subsystem inputs natural, human, and social capital and other production factors to produce the target gdp, while controlling the corresponding pollution and ecological damage.  figure 1  shows that the process from factor input to welfare formation can be divided into three stages. the first is the production stage, corresponding to the economic subsystem. the inputs at this stage include natural, human, and social capital; the outputs are goods and services. the measurement indicator is gdp. the second is the environmental governance stage, corresponding to the circulation subsystem. this stage aims to reduce the negative effects of pollutant emissions on environmental capacity and resource carrying capacity during the production and consumption stages. the third is the social input stage, corresponding to the social subsystem. here, the cultural rules, systems, and policies of the composite system will reinvest the human and social capital needed in the production stage to improve production efficiency as well as environmental governance. the human social system achieves maximum, sustainable welfare effectiveness through consumption activities (of products, services, and the natural environment) and through the evolution of rules, systems, and policy guarantees. based on the theoretical framework and the available data, this study chose the end-of-year number of employees, capital stock, total energy consumption, and total public water consumption as the initial input indicators. the intermediate output indicators included both the expected intermediate output gdp and the undesired intermediate output (wastewater, waste, and solid waste). in the environmental treatment stage, investment in environmental pollution treatment was used as an input factor to measure the input used to improve the ecological environment for each area. the urban sewage treatment rate, air quality of major cities, and utilization rate of solid waste were used as output indicators. for the social input stage, the proportions of r&d input and social public expenditure were selected as input variables. hdi was used as the final output indicator of the composite system.  table 1  shows the index composition. the data sources are shown in  table 1 . thirty provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities (tibet was excluded due to missing data) were included. the gdp of each province in the past year was treated as a constant price in 2000. capital stock was calculated according to the perpetual inventory method [ 41 ]. due to changes in statistical caliber, the number of employees in guizhou province has undergone parallel iterations since 2006. for 2016, the industrial waste gas emissions of individual provinces were fitted using the trend-line method. when calculating hdi, since there were censuses for only 2000 and 2010, as well as 1% population sample survey data every five years, the life expectancy indicator for the remaining years was replaced with the average life expectancy during similar years. in terms of education indicators, due to limited data availability, the comprehensive gross enrollment rate was replaced by student attendance, which can reflect the level of education in china to some extent. 2.2. research methods 2.2.1. network dea model the dea model, which can better measure and evaluate the relative effectiveness of decision-making units (dmus) with multiple inputs and outputs, has been widely applied in measuring eco-efficiency [ 42 ]. however, the traditional dea method treats the production system as a â€œblack boxâ€, ignoring the internal structure of the system and its interacting relationships. furthermore, it has failed to achieve the efficiency evaluation of complex production systems with multistage correlation. the slacks-based network dea model (network sbm), which was proposed by tone and tsutsui, fully considers the relationships between subprocesses and can simultaneously give values for system efficiency and subprocess efficiency and also has a greater advantage in terms of evaluating the efficiency of complex production systems associated with multiple stages [ 43 ]. therefore, by dividing the ecosystem into three stages (i.e., economic production, environmental governance, and social input), this study constructed a network sbm model that considers undesired outputs. the efficiency of dmu o  (o refers to the number of dmu,  o = 1 , â€¦ , n ) can be calculated by solving the following linear program [ 44 ]: (1) 1 Ï 0 * = max âˆ‘ k = 1 k w k [ 1 + 1 r k ( âˆ‘ r = 1 r k s r o k + y r o k ) ] s . t . x o k = x k Î» k + s o k âˆ’ y o k = y k Î» k âˆ’ s o k + e Î» k = 1 Î» k â‰¥ 0 , s o k - â‰¥ 0 , s o k + â‰¥ 0 , ( âˆ€ k )  where  Ï 0 *  represents the overall efficiency of dmu o ,  w k  is the relative weight of division  k , and  s k âˆ’ ( s k + )  are the input (output) slack vectors. 2.2.2. geographically weighted regression (gwr) model based on the spatial non-stationarity [ 45 ], the geographically weighted regression (gwr) model uses geographical coordinates and core functions to perform a local regression estimation on each group of spatially adjacent subsamples. it is an effective analysis method for studying spatial heterogeneity. the model is as follows [ 46 ]: (2) y i = Î² o ( Î¼ i , v i ) + âˆ‘ k = 1 p Î² k ( Î¼ i , v i ) x i k + Îµ i  where  y i  represents the eco-efficiency of ith province,  ( Î¼ i , v i )  is the spatial geographic coordinates of ith province,  Î² k ( Î¼ i , v i )  is the regression coefficient of the kth explanatory factor in province  i , and  Îµ i  is the error term.",N/A,N/A,N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Method|Fulltext,Yes,No,N/A

[ 12 ] to map the determinants that affect the use of an innovation in practice into one of the following four categories: (1) characteristics of the innovation, (2) characteristics of the potential user of the innovation, (3) characteristics the organization where the potential user works and (4) characteristics of the socio-political context. for the purpose of this study, a total of 20 items were selected from this instrument in consultation with the research team. the instrument has an interval-scaled likert response option (from 1 = â€œstrongly disagreeâ€ to 5 = â€œstrongly agreeâ€). an opt-out option was also given. the fourth part contained 7 general questions aimed at collecting socio-demographic data of the enterprise and the person completing the survey.  a small pilot of the survey was conducted within a group of employers ( n  = 3); representatives of sector organizations in the cleaning, care and transport sectors ( n  = 4); representatives from a national employer organization ( n  = 2) and one worker in the care sector in order to test its feasibility and comprehensibility. this led to minor adoptions. 2.2.4. interviews an individual semi-structured interview using an interview guideline was held with enterprise representatives by video conferencing due to the covid-19 pandemic. interviews were pre-tested with 3 sme employers to increase feasibility and comprehensibility of the interview guide. one researcher (fb) conducted and recorded all interviews. one additional researcher (fn) listened back to one interview and gave suggestions for improvement of the interview process.  the guideline comprised the following parts: the interviewees were asked for an example in which a successful implementation of a preventive health measure had taken place as well as for an example in which an unsuccessful implementation of a preventive measure had taken place. they were then asked to name success factors and barriers that played a role in the respective situation. they were subsequently asked to explain how they would address the failed implementation if they tried again and what strategies they would apply or which resources and other pre-conditions they would need to make it a success.",N/A,N/A,N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,DA,Yes,No,N/A

 treated it  is a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if there is a new subway line opened in city  i , and it is equal to 0 if there are not any subway openings in city  i ;  t it  is a time dummy variable that takes a value of 0 before a new subway line opening, and it takes a value of 1 after a new subway line opening;  x it  refers to weather variables, including average temperature, wind speed and relative humidity, and binary variables indicating rain, snow and storm;  Îµ it  is the error term. 3.1.2. propensity score matching (psm) method even though the did method has the advantage of overcoming self-selected sample bias, as yet there could still be bias if unobserved factors exist in the sample, i.e., different initial conditions between the processing group and the control group. for example, the chinese cities that constructed subway lines were not random, but related to the level of economic development and the environmental conditions of those cities. therefore, there is heterogeneity of cities between the processing group and the control group, which may result in â€œdifferential deviationâ€ by the did method. for reducing the sample selection bias and heterogeneity, and effectively matching the process group and the control group, the psm method is introduced to handle with the selection bias caused by confounding factors [ 48 ]. in short, the combination of the did with the psm method can effectively estimate the causal effect of the new subway line openings on concerned outcomesâ€”air quality in terms of pm10 concentration. decades ago, the first subway line in china opened in january 1971 in beijing, and 35 cities (excluding hong kong, macao and taiwan) opened subway lines at the end of 2018. due to the unavailability of air pollution data before december 2013, we choose 2014 as the time node. the city defines two aspects of the virtual variable,  treated it  = 1, or 0.  treated it  = 1 refers to the city i in the processing group, which includes cities with subway line openings during the data period;  treated it  = 0 refers to the control group, which includes cities without any subway line openings during the data period. the propensity score can turn a multidimensional variable into a one-dimensional variable, and thus obtain a value between 0 and 1, so that it can perfectly measure the difference of individual samples.  k  near neighbor matching and the logit method are usually used for computing the distance of samples and estimating the final propensity score. 3.2. data and sample table 1  presents the main variables of our analysis. air quality in chinese cities is measured by pm10 concentration, and we choose pm2.5 as a robustness pollutant because the relationship between the two is close (see  table 2 ; the coefficient between the two is high and the value is 0.886). all these indices are measured on a daily basis. in addition, the control variables contain daily weather variables and wind condition: average temperature (denoted by  qw ), average relative humidity (denoted by  xdsd ), binary variables indicating rain, snow and storm (denoted by  ifrain ), and average wind speed (denoted by  fs ). according to previous studies (e.g., [ 10 ]), average temperature and relative humidity tend to result in greater pm10 pollution, while average wind speed and rain would lead to a better pm10 environment. the ministry of environmental protection (mep) has published hourly and daily air quality data every year since december 2013. the open air quality data include sulfur dioxide (so 2 ), nitrogen dioxide (no 2 ), carbon monoxide (co), ozone (o 3 ), coarse particles with a diameter of less than 10 Î¼m (i.e., pm10), fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 Î¼m or less (i.e., pm2.5) and air quality index (aqi). in this paper, the key air pollutant is pm10, and pm2.5 is a robustness pollutant. these daily data of sample cities have been available from the mepâ€™s website since december 2013. the data of weather variables and wind conditions were collected from two key websites:  https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/zsof/date/2017-1-1  and  http://data.sheshiyuanyi.com/weatherdata/ . the second data set records the opening dates of subway lines in the cities. we chose cities with a newly-opened subway line during the data period as our processing group of samples. the data of the opening dates of subways in these cities were collected from the china metro website and the official websites of subway operating companies in the sample cities. during the data period from january 2014 to december 2017, the newly-built subway lines of 7 cities in china were opened. we estimate the changes in air quality in terms of pm10 concentration before and after the new subway openings for chinese cities. therefore, the processing group contains 7 cities with open subway lines. the details of the processing group are shown in  table 3 . among the 215 cities for which data were collected, the 35 cities that had opened their subway lines between 2014 and 2017 were eliminated, and the remaining 181 cities were deemed samples in the control group. for better matching with the processing group, and to reduce the â€œdifferential deviationâ€ originating from the whole sample, we first needed to obtain the data of the sample in the control group based on the control variables (including weather and wind variables indicated in the paper), using the propensity score matching (psm) method. however, among these 181 cities, we only obtained the full data of weather and wind variables in 20 cities, and thus we finally selected 20 cities from these 181 cities for the control group [ 49 ]. accordingly, the 20 cities of the control group include yancheng, yangzhou, huaiâ€™an, taizhou, jinhua, jinchang, quanzhou, jilin, zhuzhou, kaifeng, yichang, weifang, yibin, baotou, jiujiang, xuchang, nantong, shangqiu, rizhao and zhuâ€™madian.",N/A,"https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/zsof/date/2017-1-1, http://data.sheshiyuanyi.com/weatherdata/",N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Method,Yes,No,N/A

another was the myd11a2 nighttime lst (aqua satellite with a 1:30 p.m. equator crossing time), from 28 july 2015â€“5 august 2015. the highest temperature in nanchang reached 35 Â°c for those eight consecutive days. pixels with an accuracy below 2 k were removed, and the data in the study area have no missing values. 2.2.2. countiesâ€™ air temperature daily maximum temperature of each county was derived from the weather website ( https://lishi.tianqi.com/ ) [ 65 ]. the historical weather data provided by this website come from the china meteorological administration, and are compiled and released by the website administrator. the daily maximum temperatures of each county in summer during 2015â€“2018 were obtained through the web crawler, and the annually average number of maximum (>35 Â°c) daily temperature days were calculated. it can represent the heat environment of the study area in recent years. 2.2.3. wet bulb globe temperature the wet bulb globe temperature (wbgt) was calculated based on daily maximum temperature and daily average relative humidity using bioklima [ 66 ]. bioklima is an universal tool for bioclimatic studies created by krzysztof bÅ‚aÅ¼ejczyk, it could be easily accessed on the website indicated by the reference [ 66 ]. a total of 242 sites in the study area was selected using the china meteorological assimilation driving datasets for the swat model (cmads) v1.1, with a spatial resolution of 0.25Â° [ 67 ]. the final spatial wbgt distribution for the continuous surface was acquired by interpolating eight consecutive wbgt days (corresponding to the modis lst time period), using kriging method and taking their average values in arcgis environment. 2.2.4. air quality index data air pollutants increase as temperatures rise [ 68 ]; during prolonged heatwaves, the incidence of high concentration of pollutants may reinforce adverse effects on human health [ 69 , 70 ]. air quality index (aqi) was obtained from the china national environmental monitoring centre for the study region, and the average aqi in each county was calculated. the continuous surface was obtained by the inverse distance weighting (idw) interpolating method, and the zonal statistics in arcgis10.2 (a geographical information system released by the environmental systems research institute) [ 71 ] were used to calculate the mean aqi of each county. the annual average number of days with the highest aqi level in summer from 2015 to 2018 was finally acquired. the calculation methods of aqi were presented in  appendix b . 2.2.5. socio-economical and statistical data landscan global population density spatial distribution product for year 2015 was used to create a population density parameter. the data was derived from global population data released by the us governmentâ€™s landscan program ( http://web.ornl.gov/sci/landscan/ ) [ 72 ], with a spatial resolution of 1 km. the landscan product has been developing and continuously updating by the oak ridge national laboratory. demographic data were derived from the 2010 national census and the 2016 statistical yearbook of jiangxi province. five vulnerable groups were categorized as seniors (â‰¥65 years), young children (â‰¤5 years), disabled people over 16, illiterate people over 15, and people engaged in the nature-based economy. the per capita income of urban and rural residents in each county in 2015 was used to measure the economic situation. the proportion of households without a bathroom facility in a county was used to measure the ability of particular county to cope with extreme heat events. 2.2.6. proximity to vegetation as increased vegetation is associated with decreased extreme heat risk [ 73 ], we collected the 16-day enhanced vegetation index (evi) data (mod13q1) at a 250 m resolution for the year 2015 from the level-1 and atmosphere archive & distribution system distributed active archive center ( https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/search/ ), and obtained new evi data through the maximum synthesis method. we finally calculated the statistical mean value of each grid on a 3 Ã— 3 sliding window. the larger value indicates higher vegetation cover in the pixel. 2.2.7. terrain data inconvenience caused by terrain and transportation may cause difficulties in seeking medical treatment during extreme heat events. we adopted 30 m aster gdem v002 digital elevation model data released by nasa and japanâ€™s ministry of economy, trade, and industry (meti) to represent terrain. the slope was calculated using the slope tool in arcgis 10.2, and the relief degree of the land surface (rdls) was calculated using the focal statistics and raster calculator tool by the following formula [ 74 ]: r = h max  âˆ’ h min (1)  where r refers to the rdls, h max  and h min  are the maximum and minimum elevation in the surrounding 7 Ã— 7 pixels respectively. in addition to that, the cubic resampling method was used to resample the above data to 1 km. highway density was calculated from geographic data, which is also converted into 1 km raster data in arcgis10.2. 2.2.8. proximity to water to describe the proximity to water bodies, we used the 2010 globalland30 land cover classification data provided by the national catalogue service for geographic information. according to the description of landcover class, wetland refers to lands cover with wetland plants and water bodies, and water bodies refer to the water bodies in the land area. we selected both of these landcover types because of their evaporative power to mitigate undesirable human thermal comfort, this could differ them from other landcover areas. the wetland and water bodies were defined as 1 and the other landcover types were 0. the pixels with a value of 1 were averaged in the circular search area of 3 Ã— 3 pixels, and then we resampled the resulting image to 1 km.",N/A,"https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/search/, http://web.ornl.gov/sci/landscan/, https://lishi.tianqi.com/",N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Method,Yes,No,N/A

sample included 37,407 veterans who received at least one vha purchased care service (veteran-directed care or homemaker or home health aide, home respite, or contract adult day health care) in fiscal year 2017 in one of thirty-eight department of veterans affairs (va) medical centers. twenty-one of these medical centers had active vdc programs in fy 2017, defined as having at least five patients per month who could be identified as receiving vdc services for at least seven months of the year. forty-four other medical centers had vdc programs but were excluded because they had low enrollment or did not distinguish between vdc and other purchased care when recording service use. the other seventeen sites in our sample had indicated interest in implementing vdc but had not yet done so by fy 2017. 25  we limited inactive comparison sites to those that had indicated interest in offering vdc and were thus likely to be similar to active sites in engagement in delivering alternate care models. all veterans in our sample had at least one inpatient or outpatient vha visit in the year before receipt of a purchased care service. the vdc group included veterans who had their first vdc visit recorded in fy 2017 and who did not have a previous record of receiving a vdc service ( n  = 965). vdc patients were included regard less of their use of other purchased care services. we created two comparison groups to control for different sources of confounding in our analyses. the first included veterans who received a purchased care service other than a vdc service at any of the sites with an active vdc program in fy 2017â€”the comparison group at active sites ( n  = 21,117). this group was included to accountfor site differences in care patterns. the second included veterans who received a purchased care service, but not a vdc service, at any of the seventeen sites in our sample without an active vdc programâ€”the comparison group at inactive sites that were interested in offering vdc ( n  = 15,325). this group was included to controlfor individual-level selection bias within sites (where factors such as functional limitations may be simultaneously associated with vdc use and outcomes). we examined vha hospitalizations and costs in the year before and the year after the index date. for patients in the intervention group, the first vdc service date was the index date. for comparison-group patients, the first service date of a vha purchased care service in fy 2017 was the index date. our primary analyses included all patients with any use of a qualifying purchased care service, regardless of service duration. patients were followed for 360 days after the index date or until death, whichever came first. of our sample, 21.9 percent died before the end

approved by the boston va healthcare system institutional review board. data and measures data on inpatient and outpatient care, purchased care, vital statistics, mortality risk, risk-adjustment scores, and health care costs came from the vaâ€™s corporate data warehouse, managerial cost accounting national data extracts, health economics resource center discharge data set, and the weekly care assessment needs (can) score report. our primary outcome was monthly incidence of an acute care admission at a va medical center. in addition, we calculated hospitalization costs per month for each patient (see the online  appendix ). 26  twenty-seven patients were still in the hospital at the end of our 360-day follow-up period and had missing cost data.we also calculated incidence and costs associated with ambulatory careâ€“sensitive hospitalizations, using the prevention quality indicators of the agency for healthcare research and quality. 27 to characterize recipients of vdc and other purchased care services, we measured age at index date, sex, race, medicaid eligibility, urban or rural patient location, and service-connected disability. we assessed receipt of veterans benefits administration aid and attendance benefits, which are provided to veterans with functional limitations. we measured one-year mortality probability with the can one-year mortality score nearest to the index date (range 0â€“99, where 99 indicates highest probability of death). 28  to measure chronic disease burden, we included the number of elixhauser comorbidities over the year before the index date and the latest nosos risk score before the index date (where scores indicate the degree to which a patientâ€™s next-year health care costs are predicted to differ from the va national average [1 = national average]). 29 , 30  we also measuredwhether veterans had diagnoses associated with greater care needs: spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and dementia. we described mortality over the follow-up period and duration of purchased care service use after the index date. analytic strategy we described veterans enrolled in vdc in fy 2017 and investigated differences in the incidence of any and ambulatory careâ€“sensitive hospital admissions and hospitalization costs after initial vdc service receipt. we compared characteristics of veterans in our intervention and comparison groups using analysis-of-variance tests, chi-square tests, kruskal-wallis tests, and standardized differences. differences in outcomes from before to after first vdc use were compared to differences in outcomes from before to after first use of other purchased care programs in fy 2017 in both comparison groups. our primary analyses were fixed effects models that included indicators for enrollment in vdc after the index date, enrollment in other purchased care services at sites where vdc was not available, and time (in months). the models implicitly controlled for time-invariant site and patient characteristics. we used logistic models to explore the relationship between vdc and hospital admissions. because fixed effects logistic models can be biased away from the null for panel data, we reestimated these models with population-averaged models, which are biased toward the null. 31  we used linear fixed effects models to explore relationships between vdc and inpatient costs among all veterans in the sample. to better approximate the cost data distribution, we ran population-averaged panel-data models with gamma distribution and log link (see the  appendix ). 26 to improve precision, we reran analyses on a matched cohort of patients who had similar health care needs and sociodemographic characteristics but who differed on whether they had used vdc.we performed coarsened exact matching across all sites in our sample and within sites that offered vdc. we also explored the robustness of our results to the definition of the follow-up period, sample selection criteria, and service use duration (see the  appendix ). 26 limitations our study had several limitations. first, we did not analyze care received outside of the vha (for example, care paid for by medicare or medicaid). 32 , 33  in addition, thenumber of veterans enrolled in vdc is relatively small, which limited our ability to detect significant associations between vdc participation and our outcomes. however, a strength of this study is that we used the most current vha data available. waiting for medicare and medicaid data would have delayed the results for several years. second, for both intervention patients and control patients selected from sites with active vdc programs, there is a possibility that a vdc service was received but coded as homemaker or home health aide before fy 2017. the stop code for vdc was not introduced until fy 2017, and code implementation varied by site. this potential measurement error could have biased our results toward the null. third, there could have been unmeasured changes in functional limitations, care preferences, or other factors that are simultaneously associated with vdc service receipt, and changes in health care use and costs. however, our analyses allowed us to explore changes in hospitalizations and costs and to isolate them from the impact of important time-invariant confounders, including functional limitations and chronic disease burden.",N/A,N/A,N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,DA|Method|Fulltext,Yes,Yes,Online

for resources and environmental sciences, chinese academy of sciences (resdc) website ( https://www.resdc.cn ), and the data have a spatial resolution of 30 m. land-use data of the study area for the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 were selected. there are 6 primary classifications and 25 secondary classifications in the corresponding land use category system. two kinds of normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) datasets were selected to calculate vegetation coverage. one is the noaa advanced very high-resolution radiometer (noaa avhrr) product, and the other is the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (modis) product. the avhrr ndvi has a temporal resolution of 10 days and a spatial resolution of 8 km, covers the period from 1990 to 2005, and can be downloaded from the nasa website ( ftp://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/avhrr/global_8km/ ). the modis ndvi is derived from the mod13q1 product, has a temporal resolution of 16 days and a spatial resolution of 250 m, covers the period from 2000 to 2015, and is available from the official usgs website ( https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/ ). a processing sequence was performed on the avhrr and modis ndvi datasets, and this sequence included atmospheric correction, geometric correction and resampling. due to large differences in the spatial and temporal resolutions, inevitable errors will be generated by using ndvi data from different sensors. the avhrr ndvi from 1990 to 1995 was resampled to a spatial resolution of 250 m by establishing a linear regression equation between the modis ndvi and avhrr ndvi. all ndvi data for a whole year were averaged as the annual ndvi. six phases of ndvi data were obtained: 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. according to the field investigation, the vegetation coverage was calculated, which is described using equation (1)  (1) v f c = ( n d v i âˆ’ n d v i s o i l ) ( n d v i v e g âˆ’ n d v i s o i l )  where  v f c  represents the vegetation coverage, Â  n d v i s o i l  refers to the ndvi value of soil without vegetation coverage or of bare soil, and  n d v i v e g  is the ndvi value of the grid fully covered by vegetation. the digital elevation model (dem) dataset with a spatial resolution of 30 m is available from the land processes distributed active archive center (lp daac) of the united states geological survey (usgs) website ( https://gdex.cr.usgs.gov/gdex/ ), and this dataset was derived from the aster global digital elevation model (aster gdem) version 002 product. re-projection and mask processing were performed. then, both the slope map and the aspect map were generated by using tools in arcgis 10.4 (esri, redlands, california, usa). the soil dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km was provided by the cold and arid regions sciences data center at lanzhou, china ( http://westdc.westgis.ac.cn ), and the dataset includes information on the soil physical properties and soil types. meteorological data between 1980 and 2015 from 126 weather stations are available from the china meteorological data service center ( https://data.cma.cn/ ). monthly and yearly precipitation data were selected to obtain r values in the csle model. the yearly average air temperature and precipitation data were selected for a quantitative analysis of the soil erosion determinants. meteorological data were spatially interpolated using the kriging method to attain a spatial resolution of 30 m. the verification results agree with the accuracy demands, as determined by cross-validation. population data were obtained from the statistical yearbook at the county level. population density was determined by dividing the population by the corresponding area of each county. night-time light data are highly correlated with socioeconomic status. as a socioeconomic indicator, night-time light data have been widely used to estimate gross domestic product (gdp) [ 54 ]. different night-time light data were selected due to the long temporal span. the data included the defense meteorological satellite program (dmsp) operational linescan system (ols) product and the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (viirs) day/night band (dnb) product. two kinds of night-time light data are available from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) website ( https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/download.html ). note that due to the limited launch time of the dmsp satellite, the night-time light data of 1992 were used instead of the 1990 data. the yearly data from 1992 to 2015 were chosen. after reprojection, masking, and resampling, night-time light images of six years were obtained and had a spatial resolution of 500 m.",N/A,"http://westdc.westgis.ac.cn, https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/,

2,2,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-05679-w,"Conservation of Natural Resources, Crime, Endangered Species, Wolves",Missing,Method,Yes,Yes,Online,"data sources and preparation we analyzed data acquired from the wisconsin department of natural resources (wdnr) which includes all collared, adult wolves monitored via telemetry (consisting almost entirely of vhf transmitters) in wisconsin, usa between 1979 and april 14, 2012, published previously in treves et al. 14  and santiago-Ã¡vila et al. 18  (nâ€‰=â€‰495). the dataset includes 487 collared wolves captured and monitored by the wdnr and agents, in addition to 8 wolves initially captured in mi with full monitoring history. for those wolves monitored until death (nâ€‰=â€‰242, 49% of monitored individuals), the recorded endpoint classifies their cause of death by one of 5 mutually exclusive causes (following 14 , 18 ): collision (with vehicles; nâ€‰=â€‰24, 5%), legal (lethal control by agency personnel; nâ€‰=â€‰32, 6%), reported poached (illegal killings reported to and evidenced by the agency; nâ€‰=â€‰88, 18%), natural (unrelated to humans, such as disease or intraspecific strife; nâ€‰=â€‰77, 16%) or unknown (uncertain cause of death; nâ€‰=â€‰21, 4%). dead wolves were recovered via the mortality signal emitted from collars; legal killing by agents; or after reports by private citizens. we defined the date of endpoint for wolves monitored until death as their agency-recorded date of death. in addition to wolves monitored until death, the data includes 213 wolves (43% of monitored individuals) with a â€˜lost-to-follow-upâ€™ (ltf) endpoint. ltf may occur because: (a) collars stop transmitting (i.e., mechanical failure); (b) permanent migration out of monitoring range; or, (c) cryptic poaching (i.e., concealed and undetected poaching) 17 , 18 . the wdnr assigned an ltf endpoint to a wolf if agency personnel was unable to detect the collar signal after various months of aerial or ground telemetry (although effort was not quantified) 14 , 18 . we defined the date of endpoint for ltf wolves as the last date of telemetry contact with them. there were 33 ltf wolves (15% of ltf and 7% of collared) that were later recovered, a third of them poached (nâ€‰=â€‰11). our main results classify these as ltf, but we include results for a separate endpoint classification of these 33 wolves as â€˜known-ltfâ€™ in supplementary materials. we censored those individuals that survived until the end of the monitoring period (april 15, 2012, nâ€‰=â€‰40). our ltf endpoint is conservative given we censored, rather than impute (as in santiago-Ã¡vila et al. 2020), the fates of nâ€‰=â€‰26 wolves that disappeared sometime between december 31st, 2011 and april 14th, 2012 and lacked subsequent monitoring or endpoint data in reports between 2012 and 2013 (see supp data s2 in ref. 18 ). simulations suggest at least some of these latter wolves may have gone ltf in the winter of 2011â€“2012 18 . we include two external time-dependent covariates in our statistical models (see below), which are variables that change value at specific dates due to external events, such as a change in season or policy. to include those variables, we split each wolfâ€™s monitoring history into time intervals at each specific date of change of that variable so that its value remains constant for each interval. therefore, each time interval reflects the type of period each wolf was exposed to, and the specific dates during which s/he was exposed. our main covariate of interest, risk_season, is a four-level categorical variable defining intra-wolf-year periods (wolf-yearâ€‰=â€‰april 15th to april 14th) characterized by specific anthropogenic (i.e., hounding and hunting seasons for deer and black bear) and environmental (i.e., snow cover) factors, their overlap, and absence (table  2 ). we used specific dates to split each wolf-year in our study period (1979â€“2012) into four distinct seasons. our baseline period (risk_seasonâ€‰=â€‰0) refers to april 15th to june 30th (or to july 9th from 1991 to 2012) and is characterized by the absence of the anthropogenic and environmental conditions present in the other variable levels (i.e., no hounding, no white-tailed deer or black bear hunting, no snow cover). our hounding and hunting season without snow cover (risk_seasonâ€‰=â€‰1, â€˜hunt/houndâ€™), runs from july 1st (july 10th from 1991 to 2012) to nov 14th. in wi, use of hounds for bear hunting was legalized in 1963 and bear dog training was allowed starting july (1st or 10th) until august 31st. deer and bear seasons start soon thereafter, in early to mid-september, with the deer season running through the first sunday in january for most counties (in some counties, the deer season extends to january 31st). our hounding and hunting season with snow cover (risk_seasonâ€‰=â€‰2, â€˜hunt/hound/snowâ€™) starts nov 15th and runs through the first sunday in january, when deer hunting season ends for most counties in wi. average annual duration of snow cover extends toâ€‰>â€‰140Â days along lake superior ( http://aos.wisc.edu/ ), and most occupied wolf range is in northern wisconsin. to this data, we added statewide monthly average snowfall (1975â€“2011) from the wi state climatology office, modeling snow cover to include months with an average snow cover ofâ€‰>â€‰1 inch (november through may). considering both data sources, starting the period on november 15th (average 5.31 in; october, 0.63 in) allowed us to model 151Â days of snow cover up to april 14th (average 2.88 in; may, 0.19 in), the end of the wolf-year. lastly, our snow cover season without hounding or hunting (risk_seasonâ€‰=â€‰3, â€˜snowâ€™) runs from the monday after the first sunday in january (when deer season closes for most wi counties), until april 14th, as per our snow cover modeling. a breakdown of events per endpoint and time at risk by season is provided in supplementary material table  2 . table 2 intra-wolf-year (april 15thâ€“april 14th) seasons ( risk_season ) characterized by the absence ( baseline  level), presence or overlap of anthropogenic and environmental factors mediating endpoint-specific risk. season starts season ends season (risk_season) april 15th june 31st (preâ€“1991) or july 9th (1991 onward) â€˜baselineâ€™; no hounding/hunting/snow (0) july 1st (preâ€“1991) or july 10th (1991 onward) november 14th â€˜hunt/houndâ€™ (1) november 15th 1st sunday in january â€˜hunt/hound/snowâ€™ (2) monday after 1st sunday in january april 14th â€˜snowâ€™ (3) we also model policy protection periods following santiago-Ã¡vila et al. 18  (lib_kill, where 1â€‰=â€‰reduced protections, i.e., liberalized killing; and 0â€‰=â€‰full protection), and include it as a stratifying variable in our statistical models, given evidence of endpoint-specific and sometimes non-proportional effects. in wi, gray wolves were exposed exclusively to full protections under the endangered species act (esa) from 1979 to march 31, 2003. from april 2003 to 2012, wolves in wi (and mi) were exposed to 11 alternating, sequential and mutually exclusive periods of reduced and restored protections that liberalized and restricted wolf-killing, respectively (ref. 44 , supplementary material table  2 ). periods of reduced protections and liberalized killing (including periods during which permits for â€˜takeâ€™ were issued, as well as periods of â€˜down-â€™ and â€˜de-listingâ€™ from the esa) were characterized by an announcement of policy change reducing constraints for managers or landowners to kill wolves in response to perceived or actual conflicts, most notably wolf predation on domestic animals.",N/A,"lowest.Hunt/hound/snow, http://aos.wisc.edu/",N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,No,No,N/A

[ 10 ], in which the authors identify vaccines, nutrition, and ebola as topics with more misinformation in social media. specifically, we used the hashtags #vaccines, #nutrition and #ebola to extract twitter information. in relation to facebook, we selected two public pages with more audiences in relation to the topic â€œhealthâ€. with regard to reddit, we selected the topic â€œvaccinesâ€ in a community focused on this topic and an â€œaskscience ama seriesâ€ focused on vaccines. criteria 2: data extraction. the data extracted from twitter contain tweets published under the hashtags selected in the last ten days. in the case of the facebook page, the data are extracted from the last 100 posts published and the corresponding comments of the two facebook pages selected. finally, in reddit, we selected the comments published in two conversations in two different communities (the askscience ama series focused on vaccines and the vaccines subreddit).  table 1  shows the data collected.",N/A,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/7/2430/s1,N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Method,Yes,No,N/A

colour were not considered and were those without poultry. spatial predictor variables twelve variables, mainly related to poultry production and water bird habitat were considered for their potential influence on the spatial distribution of hpai h5n8 outbreaks (tableÂ  1 ). set 1 included the three following variables containing general information on hosts: the densities of human population, of chicken holdings and of duck holdings per commune. the density of chicken and duck commercial holdings per commune was computed from the dgal and the organisation of fattening duck producers (cifog) databases, which registers all producers of the poultry and the fattening duck sector, respectively. in addition, the human population density per commune generated from geoflaÂ® ( http://professionnels.ign.fr/geofla ) was included as a proxy variable for surveillance bias and to account for any anthropogenic transmission mechanisms. set 2 included the nine following variables containing detailed characteristics of the duck production systems: the densities of holdings raised for meat, of fattening duck holdings, of fattening duck holdings with outdoor access, of incoming and of outgoing fattening duck movements, of force-feeding units, of poultry slaughter houses, of waterways per commune, and the distance between the commune centroids and the closest water bodies. the density of holdings with ducks raised for meat, of fattening duck holdings and of duck holdings with outdoor access per commune were computed by commune from the dgal and cifog databases. the density of outgoing (from the breeding stage) and the density of incoming (to the force-feeding stage) fattening duck movements per commune was computed from the cifog database over the period of october 2016 to february 2017. the list of force-feeding units and of poultry slaughter houses per commune were obtained through the dgal, from which densities were also computed for each commune. data on the spatial distribution of wild bird species is generally difficult to obtain at high resolution, with surveillance efforts varying strongly according to the season and to the geographical areas. therefore, indicators of water presence were used as proxy variables to quantify the possible association between wild birdsâ€™ habitats and the distribution of hpai h5n8 outbreaks. the density of waterways (i.e., rivers, streams, canals, etc. with length >20â€‰m per ha) and the distance between the commune centroids and the closest water bodies (i.e., lakes, swamps, reservoirs, floods, etc. with area >25â€‰ha) were thus generated from bd cartoÂ® ( http://professionnels.ign.fr/bdcarto ). climatic factors were not tested in this analysis, because hpai outbreaks have been reported in europe, asia and africa over a large range of temperatures and environmental conditions 4 , which supports the hypothesis that climate might not spatially constrain the occurrence of outbreaks. arcgis 10.4 software (esri inc.) and r software version 3.4.2 20  were used for manipulation of spatial data. table 1 predictor variables used in the brt models. set variables abbreviation source* 1 density

reported in fattening duck holdings located in southwest france (fig.Â  4 ). considering the different types of production in these two regions, two spatial scales were used to distinctly analyse the risk factors explaining the distribution of outbreaks over these two production basins and those that shape the distribution of outbreaks within the infected area (i.e. southwest). the communes being at a maximum distance <25â€‰km of any positive (for the local scale), or being at a maximum distance <150â€‰km of any positive (for the regional scale) were selected as spatial domains of analysis

one third of all classes in the population did not participate. since the quality of social network data depends on participation rates within classes, only classes in which either 75% or at least 17 pupils participated have been analyzed. the final analysis was limited to classes that participated in all three waves, so a maximum of 501 students in 21 school classes were available for the analysis. pupils completed the questionnaire under the guidance of the interviewer in the classroom, so information on networks is available within classes. in accordance with data privacy regulations, the network generator worked in the following way: clearly visible id numbers were placed on each desk and lists with first names and numbers were stored in the schools in order to link the observations between the panel waves. reliability analysis supports the procedure: matching the information on egoâ€™s attendance at alterâ€™s birthday party from both perspectivesâ€”hosts and guestâ€”leads to a rate of agreement of 95.44% (wave 1), and a good interrater reliability of 0.725 (cohenâ€™s kappa coefficient). tablesÂ  1  and  2  show the descriptive statistics of the dyadic and the actor attributes used in the empirical analysis. table 1 descriptive statistics variable item coding density,  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} 				\usepackage{amsmath} 				\usepackage{wasysym}  				\usepackage{amsfonts}  				\usepackage{amssymb}  				\usepackage{amsbsy} 				\usepackage{mathrsfs} 				\usepackage{upgreek} 				\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} 				\begin{document}$$ \overline{x} $$\end{document} x Â¯ sd min max birthday party â€œwhose birthday party did you attend?â€ (w1) network 0.078 â€“ 0 1 (w2) network 0.141 â€“ 0 1 (w3) network 0.169 â€“ 0 1 ego lives close to alter (5Â min.) â€œwho lives near you so that you can walk there in 5Â min or less?â€ (w1) network 0.049 â€“ 0 1 (w2) network 0.065 â€“ 0 1 (w3) network 0.072 â€“ 0 1 ego nominates alter as friend â€œwho are your friends?â€ (w1) network 0.232 â€“ 0 1 (w2) network 0.268 â€“ 0 1 (w3) network 0.259 â€“ 0 1 contact among parents â€œdo your parents know the parents of other students in your class?â€ (w1) network 0.054 â€“ 0 1 (w2) network 0.045 â€“ 0 1 (w3) network 0.042 â€“ 0 1 girl â€œare you male or female?â€ 1â€‰=â€‰yes, 0â€‰=â€‰no .47 â€“ 0 1 grade-point average â€œenter your school grades from your last certificate for the â€¦ subjectsâ€ (math, german, english) 5â€‰=â€‰very good;

8,3,2021,10.1177/1359105321999711,"COVID-19, Infertility",Missing,Method,Yes,Yes,Online,"methods and data there is limited research to date which has considered the cancellation of fertility treatment due to factors outside of the patientâ€™s individual medical circumstances. this study therefore explores the emotional experiences of female fertility patients during the uk lockdown in order to better understand the impact of treatment cancellation on mental health and wellbeing. an online survey was distributed via several online infertility forums throughout the month of may 2020. this month saw the government announce fertility clinicsâ€™ right to apply to reopen from the 11th may and thus provided a fitting window to explore how female fertility patients had coped during the waiting period for their clinic to reopen. private facebook groups with key words including â€˜ivfâ€™, â€˜iuiâ€™, â€˜infertilityâ€™, â€˜fertilityâ€™ and â€˜supportâ€™, constituted the main platforms where the survey was shared. it was also shared on the fertility network uk forum and the infertility support forums on mumsnet and netmums. the anonymity of the survey ensured the collation of honest and authentic responses, giving women the opportunity to contribute their own experiences to wider â€˜theoretical categoriesâ€™ ( vainio, 2012 : 690). the survey consisted of both open and closed questions, offering respondents a platform to elaborate on some of their answers. while closed questions offer a more quantifiable means of data analysis, enabling clear trends and generalisations to be made, open questions can add a richness to survey results ( krosnick, 2018 ) that cannot be reached by closed questions alone. the data collection tool used was jisc online surveys which allowed for a fast, efficient and covid-secure way to collect the data, whilst also ensuring anonymity for participants. the development tools offered by jisc online surveys ensured clear signposting throughout the survey, enabling participants to complete the survey themselves. although the initial target population consisted of fertility patients and their partners (where applicable), the call to participate was overwhelmingly answered by female fertility patients ( n â€‰=â€‰124, 96%). due to this, the analysis was streamlined to focus solely on female fertility patients, with five partners of fertility patients (three females: two males, constituting 4% of the survey population) being eliminated from the study. the lack of available data on how partners of fertility patients coped during this time is thus an area that warrants greater attention. most participants (90%) identified as heterosexual, with 8% identifying as gay/lesbian and 2% identifying as bisexual. in terms of age, 86% of respondents were in the 26â€“39 bracket, with 5% being in the 18â€“25 age bracket and 9% being in the 40â€“50 age bracket. about 82% ( n â€‰=â€‰102) of the sample did not have children, with 18% ( n â€‰=â€‰22) already having one child or more. several precautions were taken to uphold the trustworthiness of the study as the â€˜validity, credibility, and believability of the researchâ€™ ( harrison et al., 2001 : 324) are of utmost importance to social scientific investigation. the first precaution taken was the adoption of an online survey which incorporated both quantitative and qualitative questions. as this method is widely used within the social sciences, it offered a well-established and thus reliable platform to collect data.  shenton (2004 : 64) has emphasised that â€˜methods of data analysis, should be derived, where possible, from those that have been successfully utilised in previous comparable projectsâ€™. the prevalence of online surveys in social research, alongside the wider issue of having to adopt a covid-safe methodology, ensured a well-tested methodology was being utilised. the second precaution taken was to ensure the safety and security of respondents. the anonymity of respondents, alongside the knowledge that they could withdraw from the study at any time without disclosing an explanation, created a safe environment for them to freely share their feelings and experiences. it is widely acknowledged that, in survey research, â€˜issues of confidentiality and anonymity are centralâ€™ ( maruyama and ryan, 2018 : 77). a further precaution taken was to ensure support networks were available to respondents should they need them. this was done by sharing contact details of myself as the researcher, alongside the contact details of fertility network uk, a charity who run online support groups and webinars and have a support and information phoneline. the qualitative data generated from the survey allowed for an inductive thematic analysis to be implemented, where dominant themes emerged from the data. this approach is rooted in grounded theory which â€˜emphasises the technique of staying openâ€™, enabling the researcher to â€˜generate findings and themes directly from the dataâ€™ ( liang, 2013 : 53). although the survey was designed with a deductive method in mind, where principal frameworks were formulated according to the aims and scope of the research, the dominant themes within each framework were generated according to  braun and clarkeâ€™s (2006)  six-step process: (1) familiarising yourself with the data, (2) generating initial codes, (3) searching for themes, (4) reviewing themes, (5) defining and naming themes and (6) producing a report/discussion of the themes. braun herself has emphasised the importance of describing the engagement with each of these stages in a â€˜reflexive, contextually located wayâ€™ ( braun et al., 2019 : 9).  table 1  consequently outlines how the six steps were approached in this study. table 1. reflecting on the six-step process. step taken reflective account (1) familiarising yourself with the data the data was analysed once the survey was taken offline. both quantitative and qualitative responses were closely examined in order to get an overall picture of what the takeaway messages from the data were. (2) generating initial codes upon extensive analysis of the data, codes were formulated which reflected the main features of the responses. as â€˜codes are the smallest units of analysis that capture interesting features of the dataâ€™ and serve as â€˜building blocks for themesâ€™ ( clarke and braun, 2017 : 297), formulating codes was a crucial part of developing overarching themes. (3) searching for themes the data was repeatedly examined in order to establish recurring themes, built from the clustering of initial codes. analytical observation and the frequency of the codes generated helped establish the themes. (4) reviewing themes clarke and braun (2017 : 297) state that â€˜themes provide a framework for organising and reporting the researcherâ€™s analytic observations.â€™ through identifying and interpreting key features of the data guided by the wider research questions, themes were reviewed in-line with the wider objectives of the research. (5) defining and naming themes the themes identified reflect the â€˜interpretive depthâ€™ ( braun and clarke, 2014 : 26152) of the data analysis process. the themes were named according to the collective meaning of the codes that sat beneath them. the initial two themes ( 1. psychological stress and 2. emotional health and wellbeing ) tour the first research question of this project which interrogates the mental health and wellbeing of female fertility patients. the second two themes ( 3. isolation and lack of support or communication and 4. positive support mechanisms ) represent the strengths and weaknesses of the communication and support received during treatment cancellation, thus addressing the remaining research questions in this project. (6) producing a report/discussion of the themes the discussion of the themes is laid out in the sections that follow. the intention was to structure this article so that the codes sat beneath the themes in the discussion. you will therefore see both the overarching themes and codes represented in each section of the discussion. following on from this overview of the research model and data analysis,  table 2  gives an overview of the codes identified and the overarching themes they correspond to. table 2. codes and corresponding themes. codes themes â€ƒâ€¢â€ƒunable to cope â€ƒâ€¢â€ƒadditional stress â€ƒâ€¢â€ƒnegative impact of social media psychological stress â€ƒâ€¢â€ƒoverwhelmed with emotion â€ƒâ€¢â€ƒwanting others to understand â€ƒâ€¢â€ƒdisclosed cancellation of treatment to others emotional health and wellbeing â€ƒâ€¢â€ƒlack of support or communication from clinic/family/friends â€ƒâ€¢â€ƒfeeling alone/lost â€ƒâ€¢â€ƒdeficiency in understanding from others isolation and lack of support or communication â€ƒâ€¢â€ƒsupport from family/friends â€ƒâ€¢â€ƒdigital community support/communication â€ƒâ€¢â€ƒclinic support/communication positive support mechanisms the following discussion provides a qualitative analysis of the participantsâ€™ answers, focusing on the central themes identified in the above table.",N/A,"https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Method|Fulltext,Yes,No,N/A

(if yes) how did it happen and how did you deal with it? (if no) how do you explain that you were not bored during that time?â€ were asked. in addition, in a closing phase, we encouraged interviewees to share important situations or thoughts on boredom and quarantine that had not been captured in the interview as yet. with this structure, the interviewees were able to introduce boredom when and how they wanted to, and, at the same time, the interviewer ensured that they talked about boredomâ€”or the absence thereof. due to the covid-19 restrictions, all interviews were conducted via telephone. eleven interviews were conducted by the first author, silke ohlmeier (m.a. sociology), and the remaining two interviews were conducted by the second author, isabell schellartz (m.sc. health economics). both interviewers are experienced in qualitative interviewing because of their education and practice.",N/A,N/A,N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Method|Fulltext,Yes,No,N/A

were used in this study, which included covid-19 data, baidu migration index data, social and economic statistical data, terrain (dem), and geographic base map data as well. first, the cumulative and daily new confirmed covid-19 cases (23 january to 18 february 2020) for the 17 prefecture cities in hubei province were obtained manually from the official website of the hubei provincial health committee. they were compiled to a dataset of prefecture level confirmed covid-19 cases in hubei province. except for the districts and cities under the jurisdiction of wuhan city, whose county level covid-19 epidemic data were not reported publicly during the study period, the covid-19 epidemic data (23 january to 18 february 2020) for the other counties (districts, cities) in hubei province were obtained by hand from the official websites/newspapers/social media accounts of the prefecture governments or their affiliated health committees, and were compiled to a dataset of the county level confirmed covid-19 cases. additionally, a dataset for the daily new confirmed covid-19 cases (dcc, 19 january to 18 february 2020) at the prefecture level in china was collected and provided by the meishu class news agency,  the paper . this dataset from  the paper  was compiled to two sub-datasets, i.e., the provincial level and prefecture level datasets of cumulative and daily new confirmed covid-19 cases nationwide in china. as a result, four kinds of covid-19 epidemic datasets from different sources were collected and preprocessed according to three spatial statistical scales, i.e., the provincial, prefecture, and county levels. second, the prefecture level data of the baidu migration index (bmi) were obtained from the baidu smart eye map (baidu, inc., beijing, china). bmi represents a relative flow of population migration from a city to another in percentage, which can be applied in comparison to population migration at the same level of prefecture cities or provinces at present. we collected the data from wuhan city and the other cities in hubei province except for shennongjia forest prefecture for the 16 days from 17 january to 1 february 2020, a period of massively large population movements and gathering for the chinese lunar new year holidays traditionally. the baidu smart eye map does not provide the county level data of bmi, resulting in a lack of county level spearmanâ€™s rank correlation between bmi and the number of ccc in this paper. third, the statistical data for the land area (la), population density (pd), registered population (rgp), resident population (rsp), regional gross domestic product (gdp), and total retail sales of consumer goods (trs) at the prefecture and county levels in hubei province were obtained from the 2019 statistical yearbook of hubei and the 2018 statistical yearbooks of the relevant prefecture cities in hubei province, respectively. these data include only the yearly statistical figures in 2018 (a few in 2017). forth, the terrain (dem, digital elevation model) raster data of hubei province with 90 m spatial resolution were downloaded from the resource and environmental science data center of the chinese academy of sciences ( http://www.resdc.cn ). the dem data were derived from the srtm (shuttle radar topography mission) data of the us space shuttle endeavour in 2003. zonal statistics in arcgis 10.7 were adopted to achieve four parameters, i.e., minimum elevation (mine), maximum elevation (maxe), mean elevation (mne), and range of elevation (rae) for each prefecture city and each county (or district) in hubei province. fifth, the provincial level and prefecture level geographic base maps of china (2015) in the arcgis shapefile format were acquired from the resource and environmental science data center of the chinese academy of sciences. we updated them according to the tianditu website, a national online platform for common geospatial information services in china. the county level geographic base map of china (1999) in the arcgis shapefile format was acquired from the website of the former national bureau of surveying and mapping. the prefecture level and county level administrative maps of hubei province were clipped from the relevant maps of china mentioned above with arcgis 10.7. some county level borders in hubei province were edited and updated with arcgis 10.7 according to the 2018 standard maps of the related prefecture cities in hubei province, downloaded from the hubei natural resources department. all of these data were double-checked and integrated carefully into an arcgis file geodatabase for the covid-19 epidemic study with a focus on hubei province, of which the spatial feature data were linked with the attribute data by a common field, the geocode of an administrative area. it is worth noting that the time of the first confirmed case reported publicly varied from place to place, particularly for the county level data. consequently, the periods of our studies for different scales were also various.",N/A,"http://www.resdc.cn,

20,6,2020,10.3390/ijerph17124434,"Carbon Dioxide, Heating",Missing,Method,Yes,No,N/A,"2. data and methods  based on an exhaustive review of available tools carried out in [ 16 ] and in the framework of the prioritee project [ 17 ], a toolbox including a decision support tool was implemented ad-hoc during the project with the aim to support local authorities and decision makers in the selection and prioritization of investments to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy technologies in municipal public building.  2.1. the prioritee toolbox the decision support tool (dstool) is one of the core components of the prioritee toolbox ( figure 1 ), which was designed with the aim to improve the capacity building of the public authorities in the energy management of mpbs. the other components of the toolbox are: an analytical database of energy technologies; a repository of good practices on energy efficiency technical and behavioral related topics; seven how-to-briefs with brief technical and practical information; an open data and knowledge infrastructure which links all the four components, making them freely available through the prioritee project website [ 19 ]. the development of each component of the toolbox was coordinated by one of the scientific partners involved in the prioritee project. in particular, the dstool was mainly designed by regea, the north-west croatia regional energy agency, and all the national teams (including the authors as concerns the italian case study) provided feedback, national average data and technologies, tested it and helped to refine it according to the feedback received by local users [ 17 ]. an introduction to the toolbox components can be found in [ 20 , 21 ]. in particular, they aim at providing a concrete help to local authorities and decision makers in all the phases involved from the identification and prioritization of the most appropriate energy-efficient interventions till the definition of energyâ€“environmental policies and action plans on different timeframes. in the initial phase of energy planning, the how-to-briefs can provide some basic information on several themes of interest: energy efficiency interventions in buildings, how to design a plan, select and involve stakeholders, interact with the target groups and which programmes can support the financing of actions. more precise information on the technical options can be found in the analytical database on energy efficiency (ee) interventions and renewable energy (res) technologies. in addition to that, concrete ideas on how building users can increase energy saving in different types of municipal public buildings can be inspired by the repository of good practices for changing energy behaviour collected across europe [ 22 ].  after examining the preliminary context, the decision support tool (dstool) allows for characterizing the overall set of mpbs, selecting the ones to be renovated, identifying the appropriate technical interventions and evaluating the potential investment opportunities in terms of different parameters, as described in detail in [ 20 ], and briefly recalled here. the prioritee  dstool was firstly developed as a  spreadsheet-based tool  structured around four main components (basic inputs, advanced inputs, calculations, and results) it was designed by regea to support local authorities in developing sustainable energy action plans. it was conceived in order to be adapted to different user needs, climate, energy use profile, building characteristics and regulation. a two-level approach (basic data and advanced data) characterises the data input, allowing a customised utilization of the tool, i.e., based on the userâ€™s technical skills and availability of data on the buildings under focus, e.g., as concerns energy consumption per final energy carrier and end-uses. the two-level input structure allows users to analyze their buildings and get more accurate results when detailed input data are provided. at the same time, a basic database with country- and regional-specific parameters (average temperatures, prices, taxes) is available for each of the five prioritee partner countries (croatia, greece, italy, portugal and spain) to compensate for missing data where necessary. six types of buildings are considered (offices, educational buildings, cultural buildings, social centres, sports facilities, and swimming pools). the calculations section estimates the current building status according to several indicators necessary for benchmarking the ee and res interventions for each municipal public building and for the whole stock of buildings considered. energy efficiency measures are divided among nine intervention areas: thermal insulation of the external walls (coat); replacement of fixtures (windows); thermal insulation of the roof and ceilings; ventilation system; heating system; air cooling system; lighting; thermal solar; photovoltaic (pv) system. the dstool produces a ranking and prioritization of ee and res interventions in each of the selected mpb as the results; per-measure or per-combination of all possible ee and res interventions in the nine areas considered. the ranking of priority of buildings to be targeted is made according to heat and electricity savings while, for each of the selected buildings, four key performance indicators (energy saving (kwh), avoided co 2  emissions (t/year), investments (eur), return on investment (roi) (years)) are calculated. these results allow for classifying and establishing the priorities of the ee and res interventions in each building and in the whole stock of mpb, considered on the basis of different criteria and time horizons. more details on the technical features of the dstool can be found in [ 23 ].  the initial spreadsheet version of the prioritee dstool was then converted into an interactive web-based technical calculator, available through the projectâ€™s website [ 24 ] and can be freely used as a key element for obtaining quantitative indications for the selection of technical measures to reduce co 2  emissions, which constitutes the basis to draw up a local action plan ( figure 2 ) [ 25 ]. 2.2. the case study of potenza municipality  this procedure was tested in the case study of potenza municipality, a city in southern italy with a population of about 67,000 people (2016 census). the municipality, located 800 m above sea level on the apennine mountains of lucania, is the highest italian regional capital. a mountain mediterranean climate, warm and dry in summer and cold and snowy in winter, characterizes the territory.  potenza belongs to the climatic zone â€œeâ€, one of the colder climatic zones calculated in compliance with the italian regulation on heating systems in buildings (d.p.r. n. 412/â€™93) on the basis of heating degree days. therefore, in these climatic zones, dwelling heating consumption represents the prevalent energy use, weighing significantly on the energy bills. in 1997, the municipality of potenza was the first city of the basilicata region that adopted a municipal environmental energy plan (peac) in compliance with the national law 10/1991, which made the adoption of local energy plan mandatory for cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants, aiming to characterize the municipal energy balances and plan energy-saving and renewable measures.  with the adhesion to the covenant of mayors (occurred in february 2011) the municipality of potenza started its pathway towards an integrated approach to energy-climate policies, in the wake of the regional policy that started a process of transition towards a low-carbon and -greenhouse gas economy by integrating climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives in its programming (piear - environmental energy regulatory plan, published on january 16th, 2010). as a result, the sustainable energy action plan of the municipality of potenza was released and approved on 6 february 2012. the municipality of potenza is now in the process of adhering to the new covenant of mayors for climate and energy and will soon commit itself to achieving ambitious long-term objectives of mitigation and adaptation to climate change such as: the reduction in co 2  emissions (and possibly other greenhouse gases) on the territory of the signatory municipalities by at least 40% by 2030, by improving energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy sources an increased resilience to the negative effects of climate change. this political commitment will be translated into concrete actions outlined in a sustainable energy and climate action plan (secap), which must be presented by the signatories, reporting every two years on the progress of their plans with respect to a baseline emission inventory. this gives the municipality of potenza the opportunity to foster the adoption of quantitative tools to draw up an action plan for reducing energy consumption and co 2  emissions, starting from the municipal public buildings, which are very inefficient, and whose consumption represents a considerable share of the energy bill. taking into account this background, in the framework of the prioritee project, the main objectives of the potenza case study were:  developing a methodology to help the municipal administration to elaborate a local energy action plan to improve energy efficiency (ee) and support renewable energy (res) in municipal public buildings characterizing the municipal building stock, their energy consumptions and co 2  emissions by the application of the prioritee dstool to prioritize ee and res interventions identifying feasible policy measures on short, medium and long term, drawing up a local action plan enabling a coordinated involvement of building users to facilitate and improve the implementation of strategic measures for the reduction in energy consumption in public buildings.",N/A,N/A,N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Method,Yes,No,N/A

13,2,2020,10.3390/ijerph17041189,"Algorithms, Ecosystem, Eutrophication, Machine Learning",Missing,Method,Yes,Yes,Online,"2.1. study area and data collection the mar menor is the largest hypersaline coastal lagoon in europe located in the region of murcia, a semi-arid area of southeastern spain ( figure 1 ). it has an area of 135 km 2  with 73 km of coastline and houses five islands of volcanic origin in its interior that increase the environmental and landscape value of the area. this lagoon is relatively shallow, with a mean depth of 3.6 m and a maximum depth of 7 m, and is isolated from the sea by a 22 km sand coastal barrier (called la manga) that is crossed by five channels, causing exchanging its waters with the mediterranean sea.  tourism and agriculture along the shoreline of the mar menor lagoon are a very important activity for the local economy. the drainage area of the lagoon, known as campo de cartagena, is a long plain of more than 1600 km 2  with non-permanent, but abundant surface watercourses that collect the sparse, but intense rainfall [ 37 ]. campo de cartagena is characterized by intensive agriculture, and its southern zone was a very active mining region for hundreds of years, although this area is currently abandoned [ 38 ].  traditionally, the mar menor has been characterized by oligotrophic waters and by its great resistance and resilience to the eutrophication process. its main distinctive feature has been the transparency of its waters, but in the last decade, the lagoon has developed eutrophic characteristics [ 39 ]. changes in agricultural practices in the drainage basin, with the introduction of intensively irrigated crops, have increased inputs with high amounts of nutrient to lagoon during the last decades. the results of several studies [ 40 ] delineated the flow transfer from the campo de cartagena aquifer to the mar menor lagoon with the adverse effect of entry of nitrates and other agrochemical elements from fertilization. these inputs caused a quick increase in the pollution in the lagoon [ 41 ], and induced a eutrophication process, leading to a loss of water quality [ 42 , 43 ]. an unprecedented eutrophication crisis in 2016, caused by an abrupt increase in the average concentration of nutrients and chlorophyll, generated an evident change in the quality of the waters, with important increase in the turbidity, change of colour of its waters and loss of transparency with a decrease in the depth of visibility of the secchi disc to less than 1 m. these caused a great alarm both in environmental circles and in the tourism sector with important socioeconomic consequences [ 15 , 16 , 17 ]. after considerably reducing the supply of nutrients from agricultural sources, the system began a rapid recovery, which was evident in the spring and summer of 2018 [ 17 ]. in september 2019, surface runoff water from the drainage basin that flowed into the mar menor, due to a meteorological phenomenon of the cold drop, caused a strong increase in chlorophyll levels, even above the maximum reached in 2016. the huge amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, organic matter and sediments washed away by runoff were the main factors for the primary productivity [ 18 ].  in this context, urgent action is needed to reduce the entry of nutrients and other pollutants into the lagoon. this need is further reinforced by the declaration of the mar menor basin as a nitrate pollution vulnerable zone (91/676/eec), the declaration of the lagoon as a sensitive area subject to eutrophication in application of the urban wastewater directive (91/271/ecc) and the application of the water framework directive (2000/60 ec), which obliges to achieve and maintain the good status of all bodies of water and requires the monitoring and management of the ecological status of surface waters by all member states, including coastal and transitional ones. in addition, the mar menor and associated wetlands has been protected by a series of regional national and international rules and resolutions [ 9 , 42 ]: (1) the ramsar list of wetlands of international importance, (2) special protected areas of mediterranean interest, (3) specially protected area under the eu wild birds directive, and (4) the nature 2000 network as a site of community importance. for these reasons, the conservation of the mar menor requires integrated and sustainable planning and management of its basin. in this study, the daily data on water quality in the mar menor were obtained from oceanographic campaigns carried out by the local government, comunidad autÃ³noma de la regiÃ³n de murcia (carm), and the information is available on the mar menor information service website ( http://www.canalmarmenor.es/web/canalmarmenor/parametros ). the data sets consisted of 10 physical and chemical parameters measured at 20 sampling points throughout the lagoon ( figure 1 ) from september 2017 to december 2018. only 126 daily data were available to date. these parameters were chl-a, water temperature (t), ph, suspended solids (ss), turbidity (tu), secchi disk depth (sd), salinity (s), dissolve oxygen (do), total nitrogen (tn) and total phosphorus

(2013) , whose larvae do not occupy the dung pad at any stage of their development; instead, they â€˜relocateâ€™ their larvae away from the dung pads. this includes paracoprid scarabaeinae ( doube 1990 ) and aphodiinae that oviposit in the soil away from the dung pad â€“ in this study the frequently found species  chilothorax distinctus  (mÃ¼ller) (coleoptera: scarabaeidae) and  colobopterus erraticus  (l.) (coleoptera: scarabaeidae) and the rare species  melinopterus prodromus  (brahm) (coleoptera: scarabaeidae) ( christensen and dobson 1976 ,  rojewski 1983 ,  vitner 1995 ,  gittings and giller 1997 ,  vitner 1998 ). in addition, the suspected turf pest  calamosternus granarius  (l.) (coleoptera: scarabaeidae) might also be considered a relocator ( sears 1978 ,  smitley et al. 1998 ) although the species has also been reared from cattle dung ( gittings and giller 1997 ,  floate 1998 ). dwellers used synonymous to endocoprids ( doube 1990 ), where the entire larval development or at least the last stages of it occur in the dung pad. in contrast to  sladecek et al. (2013) , who included the endocoprid hydrophilidae as a separate guild, i included them also as dwellers as i do not expect a major impact of predatory hydrophilidae larvae within the short successional span in this study of just 3 d.",N/A,N/A,N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,No,No,N/A

for independent cities, yongin city, gyeonggi-do, changwon, gyeongsangnam-do; for countryside cities were yangpyeong county, gyeonggi-do, jincheon county, chungcheongbuk-do, and buyeo county, chungcheongnam-do.  in seoul, 22 out of 25 boroughs have healthy city programs. in addition, they are centered on businesses such as healthy town and school developments. therefore, we selected seoul, which as compared to other metropolitan cities has the most active healthy city programs. in yongin city, gyeonggi-do, there are active discussions with citizens on the development of policies related to healthy cities that citizens can positively participate in. changwon, gyeongsangnam-do, was selected as an example of favorable health policies in 2016. in changwon city, a healthy city program is being implemented through citizen-centered living environment creation. the representative healthy city program in yangpyeong county, gyeonggi-do is a physical fitness promotion campaign. to this end, the physical education facilities have been expanded to provide a place for citizens to enjoy sports. the improvement of living conditions and the provision of services for the community will address urban inequality. in addition, social infrastructure will facilitate the provision of health services. in fact, yangpyeong county increased its population by 30.99% through the revitalization of health businesses including the establishment of healing health support centers [ 32 ]. in the case of jincheon-gun, chungcheongbuk-do, a healthy city homepage has been created to provide health-related services to revitalize healthy city businesses. in addition, the healthy city program that is being visited is creating an atmosphere for practicing healthy living for the local residents. buyeo county, chungcheongnam-do is implementing a program to improve the health behaviors of local residents through the operation of a happy health village. on- and off-line surveys were conducted for local residents in selected areas. the selected subjects were public officials in charge of healthy city programs, related organizations, medical facility workers, and local residents. for diversity of the sample, the experts of the healthy cities were included and the selection criteria included those living in the healthy city program areas. the survey targets were appropriately selected according to age, sex, and residential areas. there are many healthy city programs in korea. among them, a survey was conducted on local residents who were part of health promotion programs dealing with issues such as obesity, smoking, and improving living habits, and projects such as creation of villages and parks as part of healthy living areas. offline surveys were conducted in metropolitan cities from 25 september to 10 october 2017. a total of 200 questionnaires were distributed and 196 (98.0%) questionnaires were collected. in the independent and countryside cities, online surveys were conducted from 14 to 17 august, 2018. each of the 250 questionnaires were distributed, and 200 questionnaires were retrieved (80%) from the independent cities and 200 (80%) from the countryside. the survey was conducted focusing on the subjects involved in healthy city programs and a total of 596 questionnaires were collected and used for analysis. in a previous research design, only seoul, which has the largest number of local governments participating in the healthy city programs, was selected as the research target. however, the results of the healthy city programs varied depending on the policies of the different local governments of the healthy cities. therefore, healthy city program performance was compared by region and further analyzed by adding independent and countryside cities to the research targets.",N/A,N/A,N/A,FALSE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,No,No,N/A

real-time streaming support provided by the twitter application programming interface [ 59 ]. in the first step, we selected tweets in spanish that mention any of the ssri generic and brand names used around the world. to obtain the generic and brand names, we performed searches on the following databases and resources: drugbank [ 60 ], the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system and the defined daily dose of the world health organization [ 61 ], wikipedia [ 62 ], and the database for pharmacoepidemiological research in primary care [ 63 ]. the list of 135 generic and brand names

commercial names are, at the same time, very common words used with different meanings in spanish, as we verified after reviewing a random sample of 200 tweets with mentions of these words. the number of tweets excluded because of their semantic ambiguity was 21,104. in the manual check of a random sample of 200 tweets, the mentions of ssris when using these words were 0% (0/200) in some cases, such as for motivan and estar, and 0.5% (1/200) for recital. the final list of words included 128 generic and brand names of ssris. using the aforementioned 128 ssri names, we collected 3651 tweets in spanish posted during november 2019 with occurrences of the words listed in  table 1 . these tweets were posted by 3138 different twitter users and mentioned 33 different words from the list. the frequencies of these 32 words are shown in  table 2 . table 2 frequencies of ssri names mentioned in spanish tweets during november 2019. ssri mentions frequency prozac 998 fluoxetina 756 sertralina

recent tweets for each user were retrieved). given that retweets are not useful for analyzing the linguistic behavior of a particular user, the third step consisted of excluding the retweets and checking if the remaining tweets from each timeline included the mention of at least one ssri. 1800 users were excluded by this filter, leaving a total of 1338 twitter users. we obtained 3,791,609 tweets after compiling the timelines from these 1338 users. from these timelines, 4872 tweets mentioning at least one of the ssris from the list were automatically detected. these 4872 tweets were independently reviewed by two experts, a psychologist and a family physician, both with clinical experience. these experts manually selected the tweets that suggested that the user who posted the tweet was taking an ssri on the date of posting. examples of these tweets are shown in  textbox 1 . examples of tweets that positively or negatively suggest whether the user is taking an ssri. positive examples: â€œeso de tener sueÃ±os raros debido a la fluoxetina se estÃ¡ saliendo de control.â€ (â€œhaving odd dreams due to fluoxetine is getting out of control.â€) â€œyo tomo sertralina, como me lo receta el doctor y aÃºn asÃ­ a veces siento que el mundo donde estoy no es para mi. ese susto esa angustia esas ganas de correr es algo que sÃ³lo el que lo padece lo entiendeâ€ (â€œi take sertraline as my doctor prescribes it to me and, even so, sometimes i feel that the world iâ€™m living in is not for me. this fear this anxiety this desire to run out is something that only one who suffers from it can understandâ€) negative examples: â€œella deberÃ­a tomar prozac, como tic tacâ€ (â€œshe should take prozac, like tic tacâ€ [a candy brand]) â€œla paroxetina es un medicamento que pertenece a la familia de los antidepresivos inhibidores de la recaptaciÃ³n de la serotonina Â¡conoce mÃ¡s sobre Ã©l!â€ (â€œparoxetine is a drug that belongs to the antidepressant family of serotonin reuptake inhibitors. find out more about it!â€) the agreement between reviewers was 93.1% (4537/4872) with a cohen kappa score of 0.68, indicating that there was substantial agreement between raters. the reviewers discussed and reached a consensus on the classification of the 335 tweets they classified differently. finally, we obtained a total number of 518 tweets with one or more ssri mentions, suggesting that the users who posted these tweets were taking an ssri at the moment of posting. these tweets corresponded to 279 different users. therefore, these users had two characteristics: first, the tweets on their timeline included at least one mention of ssris, and second, the text of tweets mentioning ssris suggested that the user was taking the antidepressant. in addition, we analyzed the tweets posted by each user that belonged to the two datasets ( in-treatment  and  unknown-treatment ; see  figure 1 ) by trying different minimum numbers of tweets per dataset (10, 30, 60, and 100 tweets) in order to include a user in the study. 10 tweets contained little information in terms of number of words or posting characteristics. in the cases of 60 and 100 tweets, the number of users included dropped dramatically. for this reason, we applied a requirement of a minimum of 30 tweets in both  in-treatment  and  unknown-treatment  datasets to keep the balance between the number of tweets and the number of users to be included in the study. after applying this requirement, 187 users were finally included in the study. the complete timelines of these users were compiled, totaling 668,842 tweets, which were reduced to 482,338 once retweets were removed. out of these, 168,369 more tweets were excluded because they were posted on dates located outside the periods that qualified a tweet for being included in the  in-treatment  or the  unknown-treatment  datasets. finally, 57,525 tweets were included in the  in-treatment  dataset and 256,444 in the  unknown-treatment  dataset.",N/A,N/A,N/A,TRUE,10.2196/preprints.20920,2,6,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/preprints.20920,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Method|Fulltext,Yes,No,N/A

structured questionnaire was used to collect the participantsâ€™ sociodemographic information including age, gender (male or female), residential location (urban or rural area), marital status (married or unmarried), education (high school and below, college or university degree, masterâ€™s degree and above) and personal monthly income. the unmarried group included those who were divorced, single, and widowed. lifestyle behaviors assessment lifestyle behaviors in the 4 months immediately before and the 4 months immediately after the covid-19 outbreak were assessed. in addition, the perceived lifestyle changes after the covid-19 outbreak were assessed in relation to lifestyle behaviors in the 4 months before the covid-19 outbreak. the specific lifestyle behaviors that were assessed included the following: leisure-time physical exercise, leisure-time screen time, and dietary intake. to measure leisure-time physical exercise, four items from the long version of the international physical activity questionnaire (ipaq), a valid and reliable questionnaire assessing physical activity [ 23 ], were used. of the four items, two assess the frequency of moderate or vigorous physical exercise (such as running and dancing) per week and the other two items assess the duration of physical exercise every time. participants were defined as active if they reported a total moderate-vigorous physical exercise time of more than 150 minutes/week [ 24 ]. the cronbach Î± of these items in this study was 0.685. leisure-time screen time was viewed as a major indicator of sedentary behavior, and was calculated by summing up the screen time related to watching tv/videos, internet use (such as news and douban) through a smartphone or the internet, playing computer or smartphone games, studying online, and social platform use (such as qq and wechat). leisure-time screen time was further classified as short (<2 hours/day) and long (â‰¥2 hours/day). three items from the simplified food frequency questionnaire (ffq-25) [ 25 ] were used to assess the weekly frequency of consuming vegetables (including light- and deep-colored vegetables) and fruits (such as apples and pears). thus, participants were dichotomized as frequently (â‰¥5 times/week) and infrequently (<5 times/week) consuming fruits and vegetables. the cronbach Î± of these items in this study was 0.725. the question â€œhow many days do you skip breakfast weekly after the outbreak of covid-19?â€ was used to assess the frequency of skipping breakfast and this dichotomized participants as seldom (<3 days/week) and often (â‰¥3 days/week). perceived lifestyle changes compared to lifestyle behaviors before the outbreak of covid-19 were classified into three categories as follows: increased or much increased, same as before, and decreased or much decreased. covariates other covariates assessed were self-rated physical health, perceived social support (pss), and loneliness during the covid-19 epidemic. self-rated physical health was assessed using a 5-item likert scale. for example, one of the questions asked, â€œhow do you feel about your physical condition?â€ participants rated their physical condition as good, fair, or poor. pss was measured using the chinese version of the perceived social support scale (psss). the psss was developed by zimet in 1988 [ 26 ] and was used to measure pss from three sources: family, friends, and significant others. this scale contain 12 items, scored on a 7-point rating scale from 1 (very strongly disagree) to 7 (very strongly agree). the total score ranges from 12 to 84, and pss is divided into low (a score from 12 to 36), intermediate (a score from 37 to 60), and high (a score from 61 to 84). the cronbach Î± of this scale in this study was 0.881. loneliness was measured using the short from of the university of california, los angeles (ucla) loneliness scale (uls-8) [ 27 ], which was adapted by hays and dimatteo in 1987 on the basis of ucla-20 [ 28 ]. this scale contains 8 items and the total score ranges from 8 to 32, with higher scores indicating higher levels of loneliness. the loneliness of participants was classified into three levels (low, intermediate, and high) according to the tertile of total score of uls-8. the cronbach Î± of this scale in this study was 0.818. subjective well-being assessment subjective well-being (swb), a main indicator of mental health, is a broad category of phenomena that includes peopleâ€™s emotional response, domain satisfaction, and global judgments of life satisfaction [ 29 ]. swb was measured using the chinese adapted version of the general wellbeing schedule (gws) [ 30 ], which was first developed by the us national center for health statistics in 1977. it contains the following 6 dimensions: satisfaction and interest in life; health concerns; energy; depression or pleasant mood; control of emotions and behavior; and relaxation and tension. the total scores for this instrument are yielded by summing up the itemsâ€™ scores, with higher scores indicating higher levels of swb. the swb of participants was classified into three levels (high, intermediate, and low) according to the tertile of total scores on the gws. the gws has high reliability and validity in the chinese population, with a cronbach of 0.91 and 0.95 for men and women, respectively [ 30 ]. the cronbach Î± of this scale in this study was 0.812.",N/A,N/A,N/A,TRUE,10.2196/preprints.21176,8,6,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/preprints.21176,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Method,Yes,No,N/A

postinsertion (defined as technical success). potential early complications considered for analysis were bowel perforation, hemorrhage in the rectus muscle or pelvic cavity, peritonitis, pericatheter leakage, and poor drainage. the secondary endpoint was 1-year technical survival, which was analyzed separately concerning insertion technique. the pd catheters used consisted of a double-cuff tenckhoff straight tube (baxter, usa) with an overall length of 41â€‰cm and a diameter of 0.5â€‰cm, in which the first polyester sheath was 16â€‰cm from the catheter tip (quinton instrument company, seattle, wa, usa). the multifunctional cystostomy paracentesis trocar was an 18f stainless steel kit produced by donghai medical devices (zibo, shandong province, china) consisting of a semi-ring outer sheath, an inner trocar sheath, a sharp-headed trocar core, and a blunt-headed trocar core (figure  1 ), which is originally designed to bladder ostomy for patients with blocked urethra and inability to urinate normally. figure 1. details of the multifunctional bladder paracentesis trocar. the multifunctional cystostomy paracentesis trocar was an 18f stainless steel kit consisting of a semi-ring outer sheath (a), an inner trocar sheath (b), a sharp-headed trocar core (c), a blunt-headed trocar core (d). 2.2. procedure details 2.2.1. modified percutaneous placement of the pdc. the procedure was performed by a nephrologist referring to our modified technique which we reported earlier, [ 7 ]  incorporating ultrasound guidance and the use of a multifunctional cystostomy paracentesis trocar for percutaneous puncture. the multifunctional cystostomy paracentesis trocar component has integrated functions of sharp-headed trocar core puncture, blunt-headed trocar core guidance, and semiring outer sheath blunt dilation by pulling out the built-in trocar core (fig.  1 ). detailed operation steps were shown in fig.  2 , the 18f multifunctional cystostomy trocar was rotated left and right slowly and stabbed into the abdominal cavity under ultrasound monitoring. the sharp-headed trocar core was replaced by the blunt-headed trocar core after breaking through the abdominal wall, and insertion continued in the direction of the vesicorectal fossa (or rectouterine fossa). the blunt-head trocar core was pulled out after reaching the target area. the guidewire and catheter are placed inserted into the pelvic cavity through the outer sheath of the trocar and move it to the douglas fossa guided by ultrasound. liquid entering the vesicorectal pouch (or rectouterine pouch) concomitant with catheter injection of normal saline was observed under ultrasound to confirm correct catheter tip placement. figure 2. procedure details of modified percutaneous placement of the pdc. 2.2.2. open surgical placement of the pdc. the position of the catheter deep cuff and exit site were marked before surgery. a pdc of appropriate length was selected according to the patientâ€™s body type. using a conventional disinfection towel, a longitudinal incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to expose the anterior sheath of the rectus abdominis under local infiltration anesthesia. the rectus abdominis was passively separated to expose the posterior sheath, and a small opening was cut to allow the pdc to pass through to the peritoneum. following purse-string suture, the pdc end was moved into the cesicorectal fossa (or uterorectal fossa) through a small incision using a stainless steel guide wire. the proper placement was confirmed by linear saline outflow upon injection. the pouch was then ligated, and after ensuring that there was no leakage around the pdc, the inner polyester sleeve of the catheter was embedded into the anterior sheath of the rectus abdominis. the anterior sheath of the rectus abdominis was then sutured. a subcutaneous tunnel was established and externally connected via a titanium joint and a short tube. finally, subcutaneous tissue and skin were sutured. 2.3. postoperative management both patient groups received heparin saline to seal the catheter after surgery. on the second day after surgery, pd fluid (4 infusions of 500â€‰ml each) was injected into the abdominal cavity to ensure that the catheter was unobstructed. the catheter was then fixed to the body surface, and patients were encouraged to get out of bed for activities in the early stage after surgery. the surgical dressing was changed once every three days until the stitches were removed. routine maintenance of the catheter exit-site was conducted every day. at the same time, the patients were educated on pd home treatment, including early identification and treatment of peritonitis and catheter exit-site infection. patients receiving color ultrasound-guided percutaneous pdc placement using the multifunctional bladder paracentesis trocar (group a) started ambulatory continuous pd seven days after surgery, while patients receiving open surgical placement started ambulatory continuous pd 2 weeks after surgery. possible conditions requiring catheter removal include difficult drainage, failure of manual reduction due to omentum wrapping and displacement, refractory peritonitis, recurrent peritonitis, fungal peritonitis, refractory exit, and tunnel infection, mycobacterial peritonitis, and multiple intestinal bacterial infectious peritonitis. catheters were reinserted following relief of peritonitis. 2.4. clinical outcome assessment data recorded during catheterization included incision length, surgery time (from the beginning of local anesthesia to the end of catheterization), and intraoperative complications. conditions monitored after catheterization included fluid drainage (obstructed or unobstructed) and the need for an analgesic pump after surgery. the day following surgery, abdominal plain film radiography was performed to confirm the catheter position. the fluid injection was then performed to confirm smooth abdominal fluid drainage and no turbidity of flushed pd fluid. primary outcomes were clinical success rate of pdc within 2â€“4 weeks after catheterization, the occurrence of catheter-related mechanical complications (such as catheter displacement, leakage, hernia, and inadequate drainage), and infection (peritonitis, incision infection, tunnel and exit-site infection). outpatient follow-up was conducted once a month, and the catheter survival rate was recorded at 12 months after surgery. clinical success was defined as smooth drainage within 2â€“4 weeks after catheterization without catheter tip displacement requiring surgical correction or other complications leading to catheter removal. cases with catheter dysfunction, such as difficult liquid injection or inadequate drainage, were still defined as clinical successes if the problems could be rectified using conservative methods such as walking on tiptoe, hopping up stairs, or relaxing the bowels. catheter-related infections include peritonitis, tunnel infection, and exit-site infection. criteria for diagnosis of peritonitis were as follows: (1) abdominal pain and turbid pd fluid with or without fever; (2) white blood cell count in pd effluent >100â€‰Ã—â€‰10 6 /l, and proportion of neutrophils > 50%; (3) growth of pathogenic microorganisms from pd effluent in culture. the diagnosis was confirmed by at least two of these conditions. cases with catheter-related infections after surgery were still considered successful if these signs were reversed by two weeks of antibiotic treatment, while cases requiring catheter removal or exhibiting infection recurrence were deemed clinical failures. 2.5. statistical methods spss17.0 software was used for all statistical analyses. categorical variables were compared between groups by chi-square test and continuous variables by independent samples  t  test. kaplanâ€“meier analysis was used to evaluate pdc survival and group differences were assessed by log-rank test. continuous variables are expressed as mean Â± sd and categorical variables as counts and percentages. a  p  < .05 (two-tailed) was
